good morning all of you good morning good evening is my voice loud and clear
ok ok it's just give five more minutes can see only few participants for others to join
ok guys let's go and get started
how are things work so we look that that kind and we also look that merkle root it so this was one of the core concept but also so this was all about it and I see more info for some reason so you are not able to join that's ok you know in today's class mostly in a will not be there is no correlation like you know what we have seen yesterday ok so but you know once you have some
free time to listen to the audio recording in today's class what we are going to Lucas we're going to look at a transaction level in the previous classes we have seen like block level what is happening in this class will look at transaction level what is happening what are the Bitcoin scripts in abuja happening to initiate a transaction will look at that and then will look into Bitcoin mining ok so what are the options available in terms of Bitcoin mining
what one can do so we look at that and again this class is also going to be theory theoretical ok just wait for next class from next class what will happen is first half of the class we will have in a theory class and reminding it will all be practicals almost all ok so even you know the next class are the prime in the first one will be an introduction session about you period
director Birla temple to code and the practicals ok so only this week it's going to be a hard core theory so before we get started any questions so Jason is not able to see my screen how would others know ok
I will see now ok ok good find any quick questions before you start today's class so I don't see any
so now we will in I'm the last class what we have seen last year the previous week were TFC news what is the structure of a header ok or structure of a block ok we have seen that there is a version the resonance previous blocks has merkle root and the transaction list UK so that is what I was present ok now we will look at the structure of a transaction looks like Subhash is not able to see my eyes
others are able to see my screen right ya Subhash maybe you know some problem with your friend can you just try to relogin are in case right still if you have problems just get in touch with edureka support team immediately ok fine
so this is the structure of a transaction OK so how how does it look it again it has a version it as a input counter we'll see but for now you just understand there is a input counter in a disaster be inputs this is wrong type so this is input that should be an output counter outputs and unlocked I'm ok lock time
nothing but I would that time when transaction was initiated ok so this is a high level structure of a transaction ok so now we are going to 12 into a concept called utxo and spend transaction output
this is a model VLC enough if you look at blockchain there are different models in fact that it major two models of how these transactions are getting verified or transactions are getting sent OK so the model is one is called account base model the other model is called utxo model so U T exam model was the first in a min because Bitcoin came in first right so then
D3 emitra mis account base model show in the next class when we going to eat area my legs pain you like and what is account base model UK we look at U T exam model utxo is nothing but an spend transaction output ok ok so
now will let us take an example so the example here is a list is going to transfer Bob 3 Bitcoins OK I will stay here Alice and bob ok so Alice owns 5 Bitcoins ok this 5 Bitcoins has to be transferred to Bob so that's the idea so before we go and do you take some model letters going to the current banking mod
can find out like know what is happening ok save miles wants to send Bob enough $500 ok so that should be some kind of a central database let's take Bank of America NASA example ok so they have an account with Bank of America ok so what happens is Alice and the plan is to send $500
so lucky that she has $1,000 in their account ok and he is blind send $5 to come ok so what will happen is Bank of America will have a database ok which it will maintain so if you have the details okay so Alice what is the amount she has got ok sir $2000 what is the amount bombers caught it is
for example dollar 100 40 goes on like that so it is meeting in the centralised database of Bank of America like know who wants what ok now when Alice wants to make a transaction to Bob this case $500 the example what happens is it is checked again Alice account Ok she has got $2,000 then yes she is good to go ok so what happens
transfer gets initiated OK then immediately what happens in a database in VB what happens this amount is subtracted by 500 and this results in $500 ok so she's got a little got our 500 and hear what happens so Bob this is fine address okay so net result US dollar 600 ok so so this is a net result right after sometime
this is updated in the database so whenever they lose again was to spend it refers the database OK what you know what is the amount she has got and then it allows you to spend it so this is how the banking world works any questions on this are we good time taking a nice ok this is how the banking world works ok now let's look at
Bitcoin world how it works so we'll just imagine you look at this later ok now 5 Bitcoins in this case let's say that bobbins nothing ok zero Bitcoin is nothing zero BTC ok so what happens here is when URL is wants to send 3 Bitcoins that is a plan ok so I'll is wants to send free Bitcoins ok so what will happen is
Inna first there are some enough something called inputs and outputs ok so if URL is need to send 5 Bitcoins she should have received from somewhere this Bitcoins write this 5 bit can't you must have received from somewhere ok so she should have that reference of where she has received it ok so this
don't so closely followed me like this amount this 5 bit coins and spend OK it is it remains in Eliza counts as unspent ok so these are the 5 Bitcoins so this is nothing but unspent transaction transaction ok so now in this case what else is going to do was so this inputs are called
I'll tell you finish this and then I'll take on questions okay what happens so 5 Bitcoins the plans to send free Bitcoins so how does this work is so3 Bitcoins to Alice sorry 3 Bitcoins to Bob ok and What happens is remaining to become there right so I'll
is having 5 Bitcoins in banking world she is she can only send free Bitcoins ok in the in the Bitcoin world what happens is 3 Bitcoin goes to bob and the remaining change write the to Bitcoins back to Alice she sensor to herself ok when I say she is sending to herself this is not like you know she is manually sending it yourself so the software take care support the wallet take care of it so whenever you want
send a fund in a want to send some amount what happens is some amount of it in a goes and the remaining amount OK will be transferred back to Alice ok so in this case it to Bitcoins are back to send to Alice ok and here now simple Technology so here when you look at the output counter ok output counter is 2 equals to 2 people right 12 Bore 11 12 herself
show this week and output counter to and inputs two inputs is nothing but ok how much for example this 5 Bitcoins how alice's received ok so probably 2 from Sonal have sent to bidkin Jewellers ok and three from Charlie ok
so what happens here what are less is applying she is sending only 3 Bitcoins ok so what is happening is she has taken discharge is 1 and spending it ok so she is taking one input input copter in terms of him put, it is one so input counter is 18 so she is taking
and then she starts in sending the sending a transaction to Bob ok so this one is called unlocking script ok so this input side is called unlocking you know there is lot of terminologies and I will again repeat do not worry this is called unlocking and this is called locking OK so the reason is Alice has 5 Bitcoins she wants to spend this 5 Bitcoins so she has to unlock this
hot water whatever she is planning to spend ok and she thinks she is all when applying to send to Bob this big amount becomes locked ok so that that's why it's called locking okay again I repeat it again I will I will show you correlation and then I will repeat it if you look at a Bank of America has an example ok and you know the banking world as an example so I'll is now $1,000 ok she doesn't know that you know
there is a transaction history that is different but in the database always it is referring to the latest number whatever reason the database she is trying to spend it ok but that is how it works and she is not sending if he wants to send 500 ok directly seasoning fundraiser you know if you look at Bank of America sledger from thousands dollars $500 is getting subtracted right so this is of the banking world but you hear you see the major difference
what is happening is whenever I listening some Bitcoins ok so she has two unit 1 from these inputs and then spend here is where your public and private key comes into picture ok so early is knows that she has 5 bit kinds of that is there an account and all the stuff ok so she is going to use private key to unknown which unlock sanilox the amount which is
to be sent so once again I repeat so here there are 2 and Alice is trying to send 3 Bitcoins to Bob ok whenever you initiate a transaction in the Bitcoin world there is something called input and output ok so what anyone have to prove the ownership of like how I have this 5 Bitcoins Alice in this case analysis to prove that how she has 5 Bitcoins ok so that becomes unlocking script and this
where she has received is nothing but the inputs ok and output is nothing but the locking screw because you are spending it from here and spending a bow and spent amount or trying to spend it ok so this pick up the spelling and hear you get home you are trying to send so output so in this case and always in Bitcoin world the remaining balance what are the inputs you choose you can the remaining balance you send it to yourself so in this case to BTC is send back to
ok make sense so I'll take up questions now so first question from full conflict can this be a lease want BTC savings why can and spend to BTC amount remind in a list but have to transfer
back from Bob Jewellers ok so I made a mistake here sorry this has to be 5 ok so she is taking this Input and to see sending back to itself is wrong
show founded answer your questions question from Sri like so that is always 2 transactions know it is like one transaction in one transaction this all things goin like there is an input there is an output ok irrigated sweet how to decide who has sent 3 BTC to Alice
how to more than like how to decide your software right there wallet will pick and choose suppose if you want to send 7 Bitcoins all 7 Bitcoins ok the world itself will take care like you know from where all I'll have to aggregated got it Shailendra so the question
question from JSON in BTC can you spend more than what you have in your wallet no it is not possible so question from Mohit so from what all transaction I received the input one more transaction would be chosen out of those you know from the input it is already found out from your inputs and based on the
Tollygunge make a transaction without inputs in and be able to send it that's right you are so question from Dennis if I lose at 7 I'll say 7 ok and 1277 BTC can see still send yes she can still send ok so in this is Alice has three from Charlie alice's 3 from
OK then 3 will go to bob and there will be no answer. If she has only 3 that is right Sandeep if she has only 3 and If he's going to send all that won't be anything and spend amount for her that's right you are right that's right to BTC from school or not it won't be part of utxo that is right as far as question from Sudheer as far
input is concerned does all transactions from day 1 until is opened is loaded yes it will all be loaded or not all the transactions whatever is the latest unspent amount would all be there so there is a question do we have over limit credit limit concept no we don't have that whatever you have only that you can spend
ok so input a question from whom can I come in between Centre uses private key to unlock an output means receiver using private key to INR that's right input means she has to prove and then he'll have to digitally sign what what he will do if he will send to the public key ok with using his signature you'll have to unlock his wallet
write without unlocking his wallet he will not be able to send that all so once you unlock you know you can go ahead and do that take that and spend amount and then send it so question from Sandeep will it pic first in first out or last in first out ok so good place in like an hour so it is taken care by the wallet ok so they have some algorithms like what to pick into
based on that it will be chosen Sandeep ok but you know it'll be chosen from whatever you're got so is there a chance that receiving end fails there will be two inputs is there a chance that receiving and fails know that cannot happen OK when the receiving end will fail is because maybe you
send to a wrong public key which is not there ok only then another those things could happen otherwise it's not possible I mean verification fails in change so verification how it can feel is suppose you know you are trying to this is just a transaction right you make a dummy transaction and broadcast 202 that you don't have an amount ok but you still try to send a transaction saying that case what you happiness
MP excise will be there and another machine could identify right now let me show you utxo give me some music
I am trying to find in a bit convert I am trying to find out you know the address so I can see that there is a place
just give me one sec so nice if you remember you know sometime if you want to look at ok so what lab and I just want to show you that path alone just give me one sec
so this is a path write a bitcoin changed it so this is where all your beauty exercise are stored OK it is why it is ldb it's nothing but you know sometime back I told you I did you say something called level DP ok so all the unspent transaction out
what ever exist in the network it so this will all be synced up once you there are two types of wall it if you use you know like client wallet this all things will not get stored ok but if you are using a full load and full wallet and the minor what happen is all the UT Axis whichever you know whatever address is whatever balance with is having all the UT Axis will be maintained in this level level TV is simply a key value pair and you know people was whether we can
this no is all like some kind of encrypted so you can't open it as easy so this is where all your UT exorcist Road ok now considering this rate in this is where it is what will happen what will happen is ok so first staples unlocking right so we'll go find out if oil is wants to send some
ok it will be found out from utx if she is enough making some fraud transactions this utxo is received from how the block is synced between all the Machines this utxo is also sync between all the Machines Vamsi enough initiates or fraudulent transaction ok so another year will identify that it's you know the faulty transaction which is not in the utxo and that will be rejected
ok so I'm getting other questions let me question from question from Shree engineering answer this question so Gayatri is there a possibility that receiver address is invalid and the transaction gets in
gated and I think a good question but so good question Gayatri let me check once again I think one one thing it works another thing it does not ok and you know even if it fails again you should get it back ok let me confirm that at 3 good question
OK so the next question is I think we need to understand that it is not receiving it is like how public ledger is maintained that it is not is it is like public ledger is being bitten but I couldn't understand your question could you elaborate question from any Limited number of utxo transaction no there is no limit at all so whatever is an spend it'll be all cast in your machine
ok so question from Sudhir or input transaction loaded from mind blocks yes in after mining 0 - have all control of the legand what happened when so all these are broadcasted this utxo Sa broadcasted within the network OK so the next question is when user opens coinbase account user always sees his balance is this the same balances you take so that's exactly right Sudheer yeah so if you look at the balance right
I am talking about only about the full not Ok live client was a different way when you when you have a full load and if you open your wallet what happens is first it will not in fact it will not even open your wallet won't even get open it'll say that it needs some time to sync up the UT Axis ok once your all synced up your balance will be shown from the utxo
find the question from Mohit what I'm trying to say is when when you are transferring Bitcoin between two wallets nothing is being sent and nothing is been received in fact it is like when you try to send to an address you are trying to make an entry into ledger yeah that's right there is see what what is happening is when we say minimum
call transaction that even has a ledger ok so from supposed move it your trying to send to me ok all we need is that okay mohit's transferred some for that you know that should be a valid transaction so tomorrow if someone is in proving that you know Bitcoin is wrong where is the transaction so you need to have something before that a transaction is initiated then the receiver process of the blockchain verifies whether the transaction is legend
ok and it goes to block and stuff like it then once it is done then you see it in your machine so that is as such that is in its all updating the utxo sunblock gets getting my Dheere Dheere answer to question so even if you look at in a banking world so I know nothing is being done
what ultimately what is bank is making a bank is assuming that our transaction is made ok so they have the toner min take the ownership of it and then the update the database in the database your leisure update is happening that is what is happening so guys let me know if you have understood this very important concept so what I would do was so there are other slides
which talks about utxo in how things work let me go through that and again will not taken all other doubts ok questions so question again another is a question from Mohit sure so will the output transactions calculated has will also have the input transactions hash will the output in a row in a internal we will see like in a
who the heck is calculated so when will the output transactions question from all this will the output transactions calculated as will also have input transaction has so there is no input and out when you look at the transaction it is the same ok there is no like input transaction and output transaction transaction it's like and you know it is a combination of both what in to safeguard what outputs are trying to send this both
constitutive transaction question from Dennis when the to be decent back to Alice is the mining fees on that on that or is it only on the block level or is my nephews on that ok so here I know I didn't mention that then on. So let me explain so what happens is when you send any transactions out of in the Bitcoin network ID need to pay a normal
Bitcoin fees rights to this Bitcoin fees is nothing but so here I have enough for easy understanding upset that 3 bit coins and to Bitcoins that to Alice ok but when I when you initiate transaction there will be a small fish like maybe like 001 Bitcoin you left side ok so what will happen is this also the network uses or another lowest fee or we can do that depends upon the world or if you want to send some file transfer fee it is up to you
OK got it Dennis so now the same thing we will in a look more will find out more examples after that again will have a question ur so we'll all be clear don't spend transaction output so basically you know whatever you explain
Dzire Diesel ok to specific order so that is why I showed you that level TV right so this exist in all the machine especially who are running full not but not on the light client wallet so this will be there is a network keep track of all you to access so that is whenever a utxo changed changes so the network will be in sync you know it is like a ping message communication they change the state of a 10 minute in the new set of you to access
so question in infect City Racing 2 the races question so when the user receive Bitcoin that amount is recorded with the blockchain as U T H O Ok so when you look at the balance you see you ask me right now are we looking at from UT actually not this is a statement is true that ok so suppose uses Bitcoin might be scattered I'm hundreds of progressive this is nothing but suppose user has 7 Bitcoins
ok so it is the 7 BTC it is not like and unlike a bank there is not a list 7 Bitcoins there is not a single entry for it so several inputs constitutes the 7 because it could be like in here 2152 from Sunil and 5 from Charlie constitutes the 7 but can't even there would be hundreds like that no one to one till hundred ok or would be thousand whatever it is the number
Solace and spend transaction amount will be aggregated and then shown as a balance find so that is so the other dimension aggregates all the utxo OK so the consumed utxo or call transaction input so that is when you tried to send something you are going to consume something and then if you send to
that's called input ok so under the transaction right once you make a transaction that becomes an output question from Dennis what is the input if I made my own Bitcoin to get your question is what is the input if my mind my own Bitcoins ok very very very good question
so yeah yeah I am very good question so Dennis question is suppose I don't do any transaction or anything ok so if I am going to do only mine mining process and then if I create my own currency what will be my input so very good question ok so what have what is happening is by default Bitcoin network since everyone when the mining happens or 12.5 Bitcoins sent for now
so this Bitcoins are received from an address called coinbase is called coinbase account so that is networks account ok so this will be the input ok so in case in and out in is done only mining and he has received cryptocurrency say let's that yes or is only 50 Bitcoins so what will happen is this 50 Bitcoins be received from an address called in associated with the network
ok so it's called coinbase account so did answer your question I clear ok good please explain coinbase ok so it is light
so coinbase is nothing but ok for every that'll be that should be owner of the network right someone has to be owner in this case what happens is so let me show you that
ok so you see here so in this case so these 12.5 Bitcoins are received to this address okay so this hear it mentions no no inputs newly generated coins ok so it means so this is received from here to there mentioned no input but ideally this is all received from coinbase account ok so in other words when
mine ok suppose I don't do things in this case then is right he is starts to mine ok mine cryptocurrency so and he wins the puzzle then he asked to get he has to receive Bitcoins rate yes to receive 12.5 Bitcoins so for every block him Minds ok so this 12.5 bit coins in a would be received from an account from the network ok this account is called coinbase account
ok make sense Torrent did you get it ok good fine now let's look at some exam
will be getting it ok so basically this transaction outputs what is the size of it in a wide is called locking script is because you are spending this amount transaction output a sending it to someone so that's why it is locking locking it call locking script so basically the structure of it and when you look at transaction input so in other words
it is unlocking syrup because you are trying to win a while signing your private cure trying to take this amount out and trying to spend it somewhere so this about it so this structure of it won't take much time into it let's look at this example ok so whatever example we have seen right so transaction has three pieces OK Here The
you should have been 5 Okay 5 Bitcoins so what happens is 2 Bitcoins are sent to the vendor ok and free Bitcoins will be sent back to change it send back as I change Ok so this one is actually I have to change it it has to be 5 BTC to 2 BTC is sending to vendor the remaining 3 BTC send back to you know the owner himself at the centre himself ok so that should have mentioned
there is another slide which explains now this is a very good you know this is a very good example I can see so in this case you can look at and D sources and his wallet ok so and his wallet constitutes of 3.21 BTC ok but this 3.2 BTC is not from directly if it's not like a banking it directly gets nothing else not like that it is received from multiple people
Sahib Sant remineralization 0.01 in a seminar railway station. To solve these constitut together in a 30.01 plus point to this becomes 3.21 BTC so I hear what they've explain this so the received amount the remains separated as exact amount it means if you look at Bank amount in your bank account what will happen is it will show you one final amount right so when you open your account balance you see one another
the database is updated in the packet so where is here it is aggregation of all you to access ok so next so here in about every example we have seen right so there is another example ok so let's say and dispense. 15 BTC to Bob so so what is happening is and is taking you have to spend. 1 for PC
so what happens so from these three in the world juices automatically you know what is the input data structures in this case. To ok so in the. To what happens. 15 is going to bath the remaining 0.05 the change right so it comes back to Andy himself Ok so are you getting it guys any any questions
ok good so there is one more example also yeah so now what happens is ok Shailendra Singh picture is not right ok both above only give me a minute
so you mean this picture and descending to Bob ok yeah that's right this is not right this has to be Bob ok this has to be handy that's right ya SKC picture is not right ok so what happens we'll see like you know what happens so we are
MD 0.2 the same example continued this point to is taken 8.15 is sent to Bob ok and reminder is what 0.05 to hear pic in a 0.05 sent back so this becomes a new input to and his wallet okay BBC here now 0.05 0.013 this weekend's the new utxo ok make sense is one more example also
knock the chat ok so you this about it any any questions so we will know in a way we are done with utxo model now we will look at different types of transactions so ke and also I have made this video problem I will send it in the WhatsApp group if you want you can take a look when only
I want to look at you take the concept you have recording but still if you want to specifically looking to UT Excel share the love you are in WhatsApp right so anybody have difficulty joining
ok so now we will look at how these transactions work this is called double me know you also maintain the inputs you also maintain the output so when its called double entry bookkeeping so now let's look at me now this again YouTube so let's look at how the transaction are happening in a min scene of transactions ok
so what is happening here transaction created by Alice ok sir any transaction if you look at Bitcoin transaction remember one thing I need to prove the ownership of a I have this Bitcoins ok and I should have a relevant you to access then I should send a transaction for sending it I need to use this public private key made by Nitin transaction signature ok so here the plan is Alice is trying to send it to Bob
OK what happens Alice should have some relevant Input and she takes Boss public key and some amount is sent to ok so sorry first two output one so now what happens so this becomes you know this is like in a little bit Complex even though it is it called change it is not like that ok what they're trying to shows
this is his wallet and this is Bob's wallet ok so I'll just to prove win over how she has got an input so once Bob since this this week this becomes after transaction successful this becomes box input right and then Bob can then Bob can send the thing then in this case what happens so this is Joe ok probly AC is sent to mail sending it to sojo sending to Alice smokie Alice
sending to Bob Shaver what they are trying to do this moment you send a transaction your output becomes a input to other one other person so that's why you see output is linked to input output distinct input make sense any equation guys ok so let me know if you if someone wants to know this
since we are moving to a totally different topic so just want in not totally different topic any any questions let me know if you want to speak let me know I can Unmute let's be clear before moving on its own now you see me ok so now we look at different types of transactions ok different type of transaction which can happen in the Bitcoin network
what is the common transaction whatever we have seen as in examples review send a transaction the remaining balance will be sent back to alyssa self agnidev taken Alice Bob is an example ok so this is a normal to the next one is aggregate in transaction so that is like you again be upset if you have suppose if you have received 10 Bitcoins one from each person and if you want to send all 10 Bitcoins to
person that becomes transaction aggregation so this one is called distributing traction this is suppose you have suppose you need to send to multiparty ok in a single transaction you want to send it to multi party that also options are available so you can send to multiple person so typically have given an example like you know some some company in USA think its coinbase
coinbase our coindesk ok so there people in AP get paid in Bitcoins so what they do is payroll right the payroll itself will LOL we will be on Bitcoin account so that we'll all split into multiple send a multiple small amounts to that employees this is a very good and most of you might be knowing already looked at coin
dotkom ok so this coindesk you know it is a very good information about what is going on with the blockchain technology or no market symptoms of cryptocurrency markets so they track everything ok
any question guys ok so these are the different types of transaction ok now we will get into scripts of Bitcoin ok how these things work ok so what are you wanted to know why she like when you initiate a transaction OK what we think is normal in suppose if you want to know let's not take a transaction at all suppose if you want to send
send a message whatever it is if you want to communicate from one machine to another machine what happens is basic she is so what happens its underlying this TCP IP Protocol right TCP IP this voice a layer limit of studying in college days so that is of the packet is formed it goes to this transport layer network layer data link layer know that's how it goes right so that's why travis' and reaches
Bitcoin world when you say you have initiated transaction OK it is in it is written in another wallet no sleep it is written in the term of language called forth script ok 4rth ok so you can do certain things ok so based on that it is not a full fledged script like Python or Unix Shell scripting nothing like that it's a very basic script and it worked
show based on stack based model stack based programming model shoot is called forth like you know that's why it's called forth ok and it has to scripting right it is it is called during incomplete language it's no order will say that it's not Turing complete language ok not during complete in the sense in the script you can do only very basic features
cannot do if conditions are in or No if no loops ok so these were all not part of the script on this basic script has only two things either yes or no when you send a transaction without passes sure it feels it doesn't have a different state or it will not have like what you see if I don't meet with this condition in these all cannot be implemented into INR to Bitcoin script
where is if you look at it Hariom world ok so it will be more button I just want you to know so it is a Turing complete language ok so it means that we are going to learn solidity what happens with ethereum is one can no one can write loops if ok the smart contracts can have all types of Logix Bitcoin script it's very basic
ok so this is fourth like mean stack based start voice is nothing but you mean of first in first and last out so that is it so this is Reverse there is something like it uses reverse polish notation so we'll see that reverse polish notation is nothing but suppose you want to
write an hour 2 + 3 equal to 5 This Way comes in and the olden days the cock later becomes to 3 into 3 + equal 5 something other than this is how the internally your system in operating system works okay the compiler fuser for thick script that so beautiful in the use reverse polish notation
so I mentioned about during incomplete nest ok so any any questions on this variable to get together like you know what is during incomplete moving on goals of a script basically what will prove that you know how things work
basically what happens when you initiate a transaction we should have this counters ok and it should validate that whether the public private key is right ok whether one has the ownership of this public to to make a transaction solve this would get verified ok so now so this
what it will take care your wallet will be built in such a way that once you try you get a transaction so it will understand the script what is written there and then it will be coded work according to this is a simple example what we look that before you know this is the script example of Bitcoin script so it is a stack based ok so here 2 + 3 equal to 5 in this is our digital 2385 equal to dissolve stacked
John Stark what happens this goes first then this goes on like that so in a stack based first me know this was taken 2 and then this one is added and then check whether it is equal and it moves on Sunday and then its compare the sequel ok make sense
any questions so why we are learning this is because they wanted to give you meaning in fact we are not going to write any Bitcoin scripts anything but I know you just want to get an idea like you know how this in a what is that Bitcoin script all about what is this tag based on how it is done ok make sense questions
so salary will San Andreas asking like are we going to understand how the script works internally will look will not go very deep dive into it will not look at the off quotes and the if you want to keep that I can send a YouTube video what what will happen is this transaction will be convert to Hasan DTP all the highest numbers itself
will be used to compute that whether it is right or wrong ok so we are not going to spend that much time you will just get overall understanding and then we'll move on ok so Jason can you explain Bitcoin script one more time yar do that before that can we take a quick break I think we are don't wanna so shall we take a quick break now will take a quick 5 minute break and then let's catch up
visible off your back
you get a message ok say that this is a version and this is a message no that'll be the protocol structure will be the reservation and probly some kind of JSON data some kind of a data will be there and this will all be converted Haseeno ones and zeros and then it will be sent across the network right so that is what will happen so what happens with Bitcoin world is so you get
same as call message payload right so the same thing what happens it has a built-in script as well whatever you send as a transaction it is it has a script so it can basically do some certain things on H1 ok so here this transaction will have basic scripts ok so instead of just having details it is our new building capability of executing the script ok but who can execute basically when you transfer via network it
all the ones and zeros OK nothing much then what will happen is your wallet OK your wallet when you open your wallet what happens is by decoding This ones and zeros it knows that no its Bitcoin and Bitcoin and I'll have to run the scripts to validate it so that is all about it did you get it Jason
ok good is any other questions so so there are multiple so I don't see any questions problem moving on there are like you know these are the main for minorities are the only scripts which are available in terms of Bitcoin so what are the script so one is paid to public key hash that is
send it to someone you know you know the public key but we send it to Hash this is this is a script ok so that thing is paid to public itself so another one is this is now not used anymore because of Security Council then the next one is paid to multi see that is how you pay to someone but that will be signed by but two or three people suppose if you have a lot of Bitcoins and your
company wanted ok and it requires two or three signatures so those kind of things it is paid to multi see ok and this is paid to script ok so in a will look at more and ethereum classic have you paid to contract so this is paid to script so instead of sending to an entity you can send to a script that script winton can send to 5 people so I can do some basic stuff of automation this way to script ok
so question from Shailendra the scripture applicable to Bitcoin or ethereum also this is exclusively for Bitcoin ok so it really just one we can't still we can use this and do not up to a certain extent we can do something ok but you can we can do a lot of stuff ok
so the next one is the next one is bitcoin script instructions ok so what else can have ok so basically if you see it can have 256 of course what is opcode is nothing but so each
for example if you have something like that ok ADD function subtract function all these are internally converted into opcode so nothing but if you have gone through this in your college days microprocessor or microcontroller ok you can find out that you know there are push instructions there a Pop instructions and so one ride so these are a nothing but of course ok so these aapko
likewise there are like 250 coats of course this will translate to Vinay machine level instructions that is nothing but of course so these are there are 250 of courts out of which in a summer disabled on summer reserved so based on that you know it'll be used when you make a transaction any any question guys
oh that's right Shailendra Singh like some BTC seems BTC is old currency seems it's a old currency and does not have much flexibility that's right yeah we can have program much in terms of programmatically if you want to work on the smart contracts we don't have much options UK
so this one in a script construction guys just give me a quick minute I call from edureka just give me a couple of minutes I'll be back
hello guys are you in any of you feeling any flickering in my screen do you see any flickering something that no bright ok ok fine good fine ok so now we will look at this script you know how this works ok
what we're going to do with Ok so let's take that elicits pain to alyssa sending some funds to Bob ok so here you know what happen is will have to do couple of things and locking unlocking script ok typically who will unlock ok unlocking is basically you'll have to prove the signature in this case Alice is sending to Bob
ok so always has to have you know inputted public private key so that you know the funds are getting out of your wallet and so all this will take the whole thing and she like how things are working ok so first step first it is sent to in a box public ok so we have fun
this is signature right so you know since it is tag based model I am going to write one by one first it's going to be Bob signature OK so the next one is Bob's public key ok so next what is happening is used if you look at it it's called Dhoop Dhoop is nothing but an awkward ok so do post previous 13 previous one is what
public key no question from JSON like and you should not be earlier signature we are looking at like you know the funds are gone to Alice and how she is sending me know how she is proving ownership to send back ok so it's not how was you know
proving that he can send out funds OK so the next one is Dhoop Bob public ok to the next one is hash of it this one is dope just recently read it so the next one is has 160 days will not use this button I want you to know this mean no I want you guys to know about it
show the next one is public bobs public key hash ok so has let's take an hour has 160 what I will do is zero X 123456 so this is ok so what is the next one
next one is public key has one will be sending 2 minutes or less will be sending to public he has only right so that is also say like 206123 ok so this is sent by Alice and the script what we're using use paid to public key hash
Assam this is the highest we just got 0x 123 OK then what is the last one last one is equal verify equal or refund check Singh ok so this is all have to happen equal verify and equal verify check signal has to happen so looks like analysis send now we'll see like how things are
ok so what will happen is paid to public alyssa send to this has ok so Bob now these both will be checked in a box public key right to Bob's will take his own public key and he will Hasan find out like ok these both are equal ok so if these both both are equal I'll just copy paste so that it's ok no 0 1 1 2 3 this both are equal
ok done ok so this is equal verifies Temple over 621 10 signature with shoebox public key and signature whether he can this he is able to sign this ok we can if you have private key then he can unlock the fund so that I can send send it to someone else Ok so that is how this works okay high level and suppose say that Bob is trying to clean some
persons utxo here only till feel so he is hash and whatever he has received that'll be different source a 456 and has this will be different and Nikhil say that it has failed OK got it so this is it guys so there is a question from Shailendra wireless ascending BTC then why we need box signature it should be Alyson Noel is what
you know that is from centres perfect perspective ok centres perspective Alice has to sign a transaction and send it ok but you know what we are seeing now till now right we're looking at the transaction level we are seeing like a bomb is claiming the ownership of that Bitcoin ok I'll is Ascent fine that's got Nobel has to prove that yes I want this Bitcoin for him to spend enough for both to spend that Bitcoin he will have to verify
is using his private ki will have to send this amount to someone make sense ok good is it to dry the subject especially this Bitcoin scripting inputs outputs in a most of my previous batch students when they mention like in this to dry and it looks like we're going back
to old times we feel the same way okay Gayatri feels it's interesting ok ok ok so this is mentioned how to evaluate evaluating a script takes to college left that's right yeah so this all this
you know whatever I explained explained in notepad rights in this all taken and it is explain here ok so one way one they were taken display ok that's pretty much it any questions on scripts now we will look at notes and then we'll move on to mining
about Sudheer Sri I don't see any questions or if your clear Sudhanshu Sandeep Rupesh Mohit are we good ok fine
ok sammohit like how can we access this presentation I can I can show in the do we need this knowledge for practicals later no this is just an understanding know whatever we have learnt till now right if you were more focused on blockchain your creating some you know some product or if you that will not look and rotator
did Bitcoin is not a developing platform ok so for that there is ethereum and other platforms are there is two fundamental get an idea like and how what would have Bitcoin done to the world location just an introductory sessions still we are an introduction only so ok ok Sandeep not a problem no you can't
Ocean from both movie ten Shailendra you can't download this material but this material in and you'll have access to this material for lifetime ok so that's what did you take at else like you know you can login once you login to LMS portal when she looked at your course content you can find out this material for paper insert like Anal full some 4 years back I took a bit big data courses in fact I was not uninstall table
so at that time what happened I have still have the same material so we should have it not a problem so that we good notes in Bitcoin network OK I will directly jump into this
diagram ok so basically in awhile and looked in the Bitcoin mining slide also so these are the different types of modes in the Bitcoin network ok if you look at a normal user ok so maybe he wants to trunks etranzact everything using his mobile app ok yes he is not interested in maintaining all the nodes you TX shoes and other details for him
Oppo mobile wallet or mobile client would be surprised ok maybe another user is comfortable using webclient ok just a web client where he can make transactions ok and he is good to use that but if you look at minor ok mine has to have lot of details you know what is my latest YouTube so what is the I'll have to meet in the entire block history saying that case it's a different story so now we will look at
different types of what we have got what are the different types of node available available in the network ok so these are the types of notes you can see this mean on these all blocks initially first awarded came up called Bitcoin core wallet ok so in fact in my machine also I have that so this is bitcoin core wallet
if you look at this wallet so this one is this will have all these properties it is a tax as a wall and it has has a minor network routing node full blockchain everything its ok so I wanted to let me show on other thing she moment I open it right see what is happening is its sinking in a dimension right so loading it will load the blocks it will sync up the utxo only
then it will get started I don't want to do it earlier let me closer but you can try it if you want in your home if you want to try it and you can delete everything and after that so I can download this Bitcoin core wallet and then if you just leave it open it will take a while to sync up one synced up you'll have all the switches ok but it will take some time now because it has to download all the blocks right since Inception attached to
download all the blocks it'll take some time
hey sorry able to hear me what happened this the Bitcoin core 13 open Bitcoin course something in up something out blown me know like it when in I didn't realise that I got dropped off
Nokia ok no for some reason right I can't type in seventies I don't know whether it is a Firefox problem or something I can't type indirectly doesn't allow me to ok so now what we are what we are going to look us we will look into Bitcoin notes what are the different types of Bitcoin notes available in
network ok so there is some theory all directly going to in a practicals and show you like it know what are the different notes Solace you are able to see my screen it common Bitcoin notes in Bitcoin network
did you did you notice I open Bitcoin core wallet did you notice that when I opened variable to see that in fact I don't want to open it once again ok so were the idea is so the client which I open right so the Bitcoin core wallet it was in fact the first wallet ok so that valid if you see it as all these capabilities it at it as his wallet capability you can send funds to someone it can act as a minor
it has a full blockchain it has a network routing has everything ok so the Bitcoin core wallet yeah that's right ones open Bitcoin core enough for some reason I was knocked out ok so likewise there are different notes we will look at what all notes ok another thing is full blockchain node full blockchain road you just made in the blocks UTI
source and it writes the transactions that is what it does he know you cannot send funds from one person to another person ok and there is no mining nothing gets only full blockchain not its still it is helping the network strength ok so these are some of the full blockchain notes OK then then I will directly go to this lightweight Mini wallet lightweight wallet is nothing but as mentioned before you know people could use just stay
how to transfer function get funds they are not care about mining ok they don't want to download entire block history in internet access for those you know like client is a good option so you can use like client I know as mobile based and you know whatever wallet we have seen yesterday Jaxx wallet and show new episode does these are all like paint wallets where your block is not getting downloaded in your machine it is elsewhere so using this tools like Exodus of Jack
you communicate with blockchain diesel typical like Klein wallets wallets you can only do some fund transfer can we cannot do Mining or nothing much ok ok now this one this person is called 16 minor and remaining all this is related to pool mining I'll tell you what is solo mining solo mining basically like you want hardware and you start mining ok you don't want to know if you look at the current
we need to spend a lot of significant amount of money to set up good morning platform at least you know you'll have to spend $200,000 to get participated in a to participate in mining activity because the profit is very very less and since the hash power day by day its getting difficult the difficulty factoring pieces one has to have a gigantic hardware with enormous power so that gets difficult to pull
implementing but the concept is Coming solo mining is a single person invested money so when the solo mining a student you know he has to have a mining software full blockchain and networking and she has this you can go ahead and do solo mining and there is another concept called pulled pool mining pool mining is nothing but you are suppose you spend 50 50 K $2000 and set up a machine still you will not be able to mine individually Kiya profit mouth
will be very very less ok so far all these folks like what they do is there is a mining company ok say the company name is ABC very popular on so called and pool ok so what this company does is this share resources so if you say in our class we have 22 of people saw the face has invested some amount of hardware so we all can go to this pool mining company is a and pool or something and we can make a partnership with them
and then start mining so what will happen is according to your hardware whatever hardware capability you have based on that you will get some amount of reward ok when I said what you will get some or not full BTC you might get some amount of share ok not everything because its cold meaning for this pulled mining to work there is a software called startup nowadays there is a lot of software okay 11 type of startup so that's why you see here starting service at anode
Miramar startup this why is this database it's all enabled for pulled meaning concept ok so this is all about let me know what are the different notes any questions
Hatim turning Sudhir Subhash Sri aarvee good Sandeep Rupesh from good question from JSON which is the most powerful note so it depends upon like what you need rights
if I have given you want to have a mining then you should go for in a bitcoin core that can you or not but if you are just want to transact something if you want to just buy and sell in union download the full blockchain little powerful maybe Bitcoin Court this is a very powerful it can you can do everything right ok so so that's it
this will move on to the next module it is in the next module we look at mining concepts so probly what will do it will take 5 minute break and then let's catch up again 9:13 right so prob will catch up at 9:19 or something before we move on to the next model ok
before moving to next module let me know if you have any questions till now in a whatever you need anything you are stuck up or something let me know so question from Sudheer like how does lightweight so sweet let's wait for another 5 minutes ok so others also join that others also
yes let's get started ok personal work couple of questions
Run full nude in your machine okay someone else's running it for you its address or something like that ok and so moment you make a transaction you go look in this machine has the full not let us say that we have a chat server yes machine ok just server for example Run 2 full know what happens is this connects with this machine and then find out what is on the block and then it in tracks
that is a bed bugs and in terms of private key and public key right what happens they used a concept called bit 32 again it is very vast topic I just enough find out if your YouTube or somewhere we can just find out it works in on Flipkart big 32 protocol this lightweight client with 32 wallet out the big 32 protocol
ok or kya ok look at this so they have your why this big 32 protocol is because instead of a private key you will be getting something like Innova diesel I don't I don't want to go into in a deep dive into it there something called shape shift which maintains you know some cryptographic way
maintaining your keys and how you you maintaining your own cryptokeys but your ki will be somewhere else Ok so that's why they this you know this these kinds work so this is up to you to learn and cancel let me know like I know if person if you want to learn let me know so this uses bit32 assay protocol to for from whenever if you want to say lightweight client to interact with the blockchain so the idea is a blockchain
not in your machine installing wanted our mobile wallet your role stuffers outside its elsewhere but still you are communicating security ok make sense device answer your questions with your Shailendra ok no prob so now what we're going to do next is
was having a blockchain it is meaning that in a lightweight client means lightweight wins you don't want to have interblock history right now we are in 5000 blocks right you don't don't have the entire blocks you don't want to have the entire UT access but still you would be an a** end user who will do everything right when we understand the concept because we take the is we like to download stuff but if you look at the end user they are not interested in downloading if you want to make a transaction brcc
Amit usability should be very easy ok so for those so the blogs the YouTube so you know these details will be outside its will not be in their computer still they will be able to do transaction using this with 32 protocol ok guys so now let's move on and again
ok so next sometime it is all going to be theory we have already discussed this ok but again I'll touch base maybe some concepts wil wil more but the objective of this classes to understand mining ok so mining we know that how this person is getting solved all those that is where seen it before main concerns you are going to see is what is pooled money okay instead of solo mining what is the concept of pool mining how does it work so we look at that alone
this is bitcoin economics again guys so sorry about that it's all going to be theory again I am no choice so from next week in we will see practicals ok so next week from next week off also first half of the session it will be theory after that it's fully practical only till the end of this course LOL be practical just you hold on for this class 11 Bitcoin economics ok sir
we all know that if you look at the Bitcoin it was created only there will be only 21 million Bitcoins ever created that that is the max cap ok so like I mentioned before why 21 million why that arbitrary number no one knows why ok but that is 21 million satoshi has may be done some calculation and been out since the demand is going to increase 21 million
short like it should be sufficient and every four years initial it started from 50 Bitcoins every 10 minutes or network automatically releases Bitcoins ok so every four years it'll be half by 2 ok so in the year 2010 it was 50 Bitcoins then later became 25 and we are into 12.5 so this will go on
on and on and it will take 20 14321 337 to consume all the Bitcoins all the 21 million Bitcoins ok so that said ok so this is the major thing every 4 years or 4 years or this many blocks ok so after that there will not be any Bitcoins so it will be running on the transaction fee
any questions on this ok moving on so bit coins and money supply in same if you look at our Fiat currency with print currency if you look at India or any country depending upon the demand and supply your inflation and other details I will calculated
reason that the currency is printed ok so suppose lipstick simple example anybody price keeps increasing right so for example what you want you can see for a 4 gallon of milk in ml so probly you spend $1 or 1 rupees and tomorrow you are going to spend 200 rupees in Indian value
Dollars in US ok so what happens if you need to give two currencies right now you need to pay more ok so to pay more you need to print more so that save it works so in the society the things price and value gets increased and based on that the currency has to be created by the country ok Bitcoin works the other way around ok so Bitcoin it so if you have one bitcoin it
value gets increases if you look at the currency if you look at $100 below 100 rupee note it is always under rupees it's not going to change right but Bitcoins not the not like that ok so one bitcoin in 2010 was like few cents and one bitcoin now in today morning it was $7,600 ok so it keeps changing so the if there is a mass adoption like it when people lol
people started using Bitcoin it's the value could go up drastically ok it could even touch $50,000 for Bitcoin so that is what people feel so ok questions on this moving on
so how do we create Bitcoins by now we all know like how Bitcoins are generated in to the network it is by the process called Bitcoin mining mining also we have already seen ok so once once again we'll see like I mentioned before like gold like anyone one has to mint gold means what to do you do Gold mining he takes the voice cleans up and do several processor likewise in the Bitcoin world one has to perform lot of calculations
and one she proves a mathematically rate calculation would be awarded that Bitcoins ok ok with him enough computation power that said so in terms of mining ok Aasai Machan mining there are two types of mining wonders solo mining and other one is a gold mine what is solo
so you have a computer you have your hardware you start mining and whatever you get all the profit is US here if you look at because there is no partial profit ok especially for Solo - so it is like you know you have spend so much amount of hash rate and but if you are not able to solve the puzzle you are not know you are going to get just zero OK it is sincere spent 8 minutes of effort and so many hashes so many billions of stars
since you have done you can't you get any reward out of it but when it comes to fold mining and the concept slightly different so group of people join together and then they start mining so in this case what happens if since you have some hardware and they would have put up some effort you get a share not like you know you are not going to get 12.5 Bitcoins but according to how much every of work accordingly you get a shower ok so kind the current trend it is recommended that you only go for
until unless you are given you know your super busy enough to build a very good hardware we should go for Gold mining only let me show you like you know this mining mostly happens in China and also it happens in Ireland ok I'll show you picture like Ireland mining rigs how it looks give me a minute
there was a very good picture right see you know see how many hardwares their mittens so many so many Ricks ok we cannot compete with these guys ok so that's why they suggest that we go to pull my ok so this is
all this mining Rig company I just want to give you a glimpse of it like what it is so there is a question from Shri since issuance reward will be very slow and low going forward how it increases -2 mind ok so you know
is the demand right so when the Bitcoin prices increases - will not lose interest the reason being right there in western more hardware because he will get 12.5 Bitcoins ok and they already built in the Empire ok so probly they had more weeks so there already into the business if you would you get 12 how much you get to get 12.5 Bitcoins is what sometime back it was $20,000 ok even if it is $12,000 you get a lot of money
so that motivates people to still my question from one I will get only the pool mining means so that there is a concept over there for an just wait till the end of the class will look at how this revenue share is implemented in Pullman question from Gayatri input mining what is the requirement to mind from hardware perspective so basic requirements will be there OK some kind of you know if you go with your laptop you won't be able to participate basic I'm on
hardware stuff so they calculate the a piece of software can run Union machine and find out like in what is your capability how much amount of hashpower you can mine ok it will tell you how to join Puram I have not done so but very good pool mining and poor thing and pool ok so just
I don't want to get into some anti-virus during the class and pool looks so for some reason its and it's looks like a risky I don't want to do it during the course of the class work and just
ok and pool is one type of Bitcoin mining company full mining company ok so these are the two types of money any other questions so Shailendra you'll have to first built a basic hardware ok and talk to this mining companies they have customer support and all the stuff and bass
that you have to invest some like since you are going to pass the printer problem should give some advance amount or something like that and then you can park you can chat me ok so how solo mining works will look at that ok so we know that you know my name is nothing but basically what is my name you get a block you solve the puzzle once you solve the puzzle broadcast the net
if they all get if the block is verified and accepted by a group of people ok after certain confirmations you get a reward that is solo mining ok as simple as that so that I don't see any question from tiruttani Mohit Subhash Sandeep Rana Dennis all good right
ok fine so so these are some of the criterias which are done by the Magnus unit before even starting the main basically what they need to do is high level they have to find the transactions a group them into a block and then start mining ok good I'll have to check the legitimacy of the transactions ok
verify the utxo and stuff like that ok so will look at one by one shot on a mistake of every transaction meaning that whatever transaction you are going to add it in a block has to be verified OK then independent aggregation of this transaction so if you want to mine A block it is not like you know you pick one transaction and then you can start me know you'll have to have a subgroup of transactions so you'll have to wait for sometime group all this aggregate out
transaction and then start my ok so this is the independent aggregation software aggregation what do you do you start this proof of work I'll come ok try to find out the person third one is what so once you get the block you propagate to the network and then the man who was in the network they verify that yes this blog is a valid block and they give your confirmation OK then
this is our split into two okay out and get together in a chain so it makes a chain then with the most so here they bring in a concept called longest chain ok so even though if you win it will take some time and it'll make sure that you after the confirmations the six or seven confirmation it find out yes this is the longest Chain and people will follow your Chain and you also you will get a reward
question guys SOL stuff you've already seen only ok nothing so now write these four walls this one will see individually like what each one is doing so first one is what independent verification of a transaction whether the transaction if else is sending a transaction to Bob plato's she said she sending to 3 Bitcoins is it really wallet transaction
weather alice's really has that amount matches to the utxo IT verifies the transaction and then it passes so this is all independent independent verifying verification of transactions ok question guys ok so what all things will get validated in the end when you look
the transaction some transaction is been initiated so what all get 12 digit so these are the validation criteria basically also this transaction punctuation so its like the structure should be right it's not right it's going to disregard and transaction we know that there should be an input and output ok without input output what are you trying to send that one and one
cats and Hero picture and send one cannot send more than the network owns so these all basic conditions are checked ok a matching transaction in the pool or unblock us in this is important. Ok so what happens if you look at the transaction rights to these transactions are grouped and then friend in a block whatever it will see is see if you if you already have the transaction
block the transaction will get will get disregarded UK and there is a transaction which refers to the previous transactions that should be there OK solve this basic criteria will be checked give a minute
Sandeep was very good I think you have type 10 problems on the violin mute you look like your pic question ok after going through this checklist tile on YouTube we can discuss next one is Input and outputs me know that I know what are the reference inputs outputs for example you cannot spend more than what we know you more than you if you say inputs you should have 5 Bitcoins should reflect in your utxo ok and suppose you have sent to all ready to someone
Chalisa send 5 Bitcoins to Bob already ok and she cannot double spend again solve this validation should be done before aggregating this transactions into a block ok so let me Unmute Sandeep happy but you're good to talk now can I meet
first let me read out the question given that money happen at block level and blocks can transaction at random level Block 1 will have transaction ABC block two wheeler BCD so U Block 1 get confirmed and validated first then then ABC will get confirmed what happens when blocked to get mine and validated yeah yeah yeah I can understand
probly let me I don't know which Sandeep and continuing to write Sandeep yeah yeah ok good so what will happen in this case is right so all the transaction the remaining transaction what you are looking for like BF right so other transactions which other mind is trying to mind that will not get through ok so big
they'll be ultimately they'll be only 1 min OK then the remaining transaction will go as an unconfirmed ok and it has to be mind again and it becomes a circle then yet become social getting selected the only thing
it can only thing you get an assurance that she definitely to get mind but if not this blocked in some other block it you go through OK got it ok any other questions Sandeep now so what is the next criteria right independent aggregate
transaction so if you look at full notes ok we looked different types of notary this full notes also maintain something called transaction pool okay saw him pull on memory full OK what it does this they collect all the unconfirmed transactions what is unconfirmed transactions which are not existing in the blocks and it's a completely new transactions ok so these transactions will be loaded in the memory in a moment the time comes in this
put into a block and then they will start my ok so this is the aggregation of transactions so Here they were mentioned a word called candidate block so nothing but this particular node things that you know I have 2000 transactions I start my ok so this weekend this house and transaction becomes a candidate block yes there could be totally another set of 2000 transactions this could be a doctor so I really who wins the race and who
who is which blocks gifts is getting propagated in internship on the network ok guys so another beauty of it right so if you look at the consensus one can think like ok sorry pic immediately hundred transaction and then I will start mining ok so other guy will collect house and transaction by the time I will complete money doesn't work that way also moment 21 you spent on transactions another guy has been thousand transaction
she'll be a winner CS is validating lot of transaction and even point of time so that's why consensus comes into picture any questions or anybody wants to talk have interactive session feel free so you know this one day off pic to graphically represented so so and he is
ok so what happens it receives block 27381 signifies ok so now this end of any have a question yeah yeah probly I can you let me finish this and then meet you ok so tell this to 73816 block is done so for the next step potential block ok so and his node is looking for this
unconfirmed transactions it is grouping ok once it collects from the pool this transaction so what happens if gets solve the puzzle and all the stuff goes through ok ok so you look at here so it becomes in the week collection the memory full busy this becomes a candidate block then finally goes to proof of Calcutta
ok guys let me and mutiny do you want to talk so I can Unmute you ok?
100 transactions and minor be exam 2010 section in Apex ABC and minor be bigfix BC the time for hundred transaction will be less than thousands when he complete binary complete first then automatically like he becomes the winner but the number of transactions which he took is less than the B minor right
my name will be get validated right by Dadar - know if there is hundred transaction weekend my net faster think like that transaction we can mind 5000 transaction week and it will take some time it doesn't work like that ok whether it be Hunter transaction
transaction you are going to wait for the same difficulty factor ok you will have to find out the nouns number which will take trillions of calculation method be Hunter transaction autosum translate doesn't matter thank you thank you
show anybody else want to have a discussion Shailendra problem you Shailendra other questions from Shri what happened to candidate block f minor cannot finish the puzzle minor cannot finish the person then he is in all this transaction will go to unconfirmed transaction then again some other reminder will have to mine at some point of time
Jago at Shailendra I have the same question as per my husband I'm on top of that I am asking like its position block B is having on IMO number of transactions but the limitation of the block size no sir so the time what block B will take that block generated by RBI
take it will be more that case we will be always losers no that's what I said right so it doesn't matter on the number of transaction you fit into a blog ok it matters like how much difficulty your a** to solve you will be asked to solve 1billion transactions are 1billion calculations so whether it be hundred translate 4203 have to 30
30 will be for a and 40 30 difficulty will be for me also had difficulty level will be the same for both of them and difficulty level will be same but nots will be different because your transaction it will totally give your different has number okay 4000 transaction if you give you a different number so maybe one day this one guys nonce number maybe he could get faster so that person could take more time ok
completely random you getting it know but I have this app dependent will get the reason you are doing some days ok some probability ok not ok we need to find this number 0 0
812 it against this we tried and the binary world is it correct correct 1234@gmail.com ke has you know what network is telling that you need to find out 5 zeros in front
so 2 minus are trying to solve OK then what will happen is 1 minus trying to find doesn't know he is doing some calculations and he has come up with this is actually 484 100 1888 ok fine so another another person right another person is coming up with some another number
5001 ok let's take this number it is very small right ok both are they both are trying to find only 5 zeros in front ok but see here this translates to 1 correct this translate 24 UK in this case who will win first the first calculation Lee will be correct yes
so even though the number of zeros are more okay 50 for some reason he is lucky ok he was lucky and he in the first non sonli has won it ok so here annonce becomes 4 you got it this dance becomes 4 here runonce becomes for now who will be a winner win who has won first and the second one ride
nothing criteria 117 ok this person I solve 100 transactions this person has solved mm transactions ok now what will happen is known as one will they will broadcast that I know I am a winner mind is not one other person also will broadcast that not for I am a winner but what protocol state
yes ok even though that could be winners will have to find me know who wins first is matter but there are other things also who has done more transactions in this case this person has spent or you know he is helping the network that in a CS picked up so many transaction in the assault so even though both are found the answer nonpolar this person right he will be given 12.5 bit. Make sense
any questions know anybody any other questions Rupesh any any example of a person minor needs to solve Rupees did you listen to the first class first class audio
ok so you can give an example you so we have some time zone amino and taking time to discuss because since we have some time we were looking at the same concept Rupesh you know it's a big topic actually so high level what he has to do this
sha 256 of sha 256 ok of annonce number ok he is trying to solve this number ok if it is time to solve a header ok so headed whatever is trying to frame this head at the start to feel she is doing twice knock a this header also contain something like a
no not set contains in on other numbers are fixed okay dance plus some other details okay that has both things things ok so what will happen is minor will continuously change this number from 1 to 18 code on one and he will have to warn you last 300 / and it will go on and on please find the number which has given number of zeros did you get it let me know if you want to talk
ok good so question from Sri you so kindly block is temporary yeah that's temporary until unless candidate block is mind and added to the blockchain it is temporary ok so good so any
buddy has any other questions I hope I answered questions okay so let's move on so and deconstruction block header OK what we have seen read so solve the transaction is got yes he love to frame this merkle root
physical data when he gets from the network based on this is frame slider and then he will has twice its on doing that and find salgado ok my tracks tries to catch the person ok so here you see the goal is now to find a value for the non ok that is less than the difficulty target so this is what we need to find continuously OK so the mining note will need to
billions trillions of nouns values to enormous calculation has to be done to derive but that particular result ok so that's what we have already seen once again so ke how the difficulty target know the difficulty right we see that there is a difficulty number of bits in the blockchain header ok so I told you right network
automatically calculate this difficulty factor if you look at 8 o'clock ok see have you seen this difficulty but how this is calculated using this formula will not go deep dive into this but you know in your free time you can find out like how this is getting calculated he can take this values
no network is connected you can find out ok so difficult equations change I should you write in the first class you look at Block 1 the difficulty factor was just 21 and now a beer and some billions that's about it so
successfully mining the block ok so what happens once you frame the candidate block and then you keep for finding that result once you and you know they are mentioned c and d has several mining rigs so competition is done so fast and then there trying to find out the right result ok so after that she after sometime after why this 11 minutes is difficult
it's difficult steaks sometime ok after sometime then what will happen is after so many calculations then you will become a winner ok once after you become a winner the minor transmits the block to all HPS that is it broadcast that you know I am the winner then other - takes it validation propagate as a new block
questions yeah astronomy has value nonce computation everything is done by the software manually been all we need to do is will have to set up a hardware once you set up a hardware then if you install this mining Rig uninstall good sometime back in 2010/2011 it was given simpler
ok so any other questions
sunnext is forming a chain ok forget it same validation then you blocked so it is getting propagated in the network and so basically what other - validate like you in terms of a block like syntactically incorrect weather difficulty was achieved so there are some certain conditions this condition
checked OK you know sometime back I mentioned that first transaction is coinbase generation read coinbase account this details of it and then added to the blockchain so there is a question from timings of winning is depending on how an hour hardware speed yeah that's right depending on your hardware how efficient you are able to solve the calculation ok so
so just give me a minute so we look at me in China fun blocks and then want to my money and has it ok so let's take you know one another 5 minute break ok after that what we are going to look this will look at again there are some half and same thing what we're seeing actually means
secondary chain we look at that and then we'll go to the mining concept
love theme my innocent got robbed of fun joint back
we look at the changing concepts and then will you get a minute ok so till now any questions ok so here looks like you got some questions give me a minute there is a question from Gayatri is blocked validation also done through the software or manual is so everything is softwares
Nokia protocol based so nothing is done manually ok fine so next owners assembling and selecting the chain of blocks ok so now what happens we have seen some time right so that was question from Shailendra and think from Gayatri or Tarini that you know what happens if two blocks get mind at the same time ok so there was one Block with the hunter transaction 1000 transactions what else
come to those black hole be the winner and how does it work ok so what will happen is she looked at look at here ok so I give this example ok so there was this is a minor ok norms for this is my name is my hobby
then there is Minority and so on ok so there is a lot of - ok let's take for resume for example that everyone has found ok ok there is one more what I want you too so there is minor ABC and so on ok so answer for tell alot of minus you witnessed
to solve and what happens when the transactions all seem so they all have the same number of transactions 3000 transaction each of them they all work done the same difficulty level spend same amount of effort then who will be the winner okay in that case what happens is this is that case ok so that is in the first class used in there is a blue chair green China be located demographically like you know Australia se in us din something like that ok so like
inner wear just now finding out the same thing in this case when the network is not able to differentiate between who is the winner UK all three claim to be the winners and they all done enough amount of work then what happens in that scenario what will happen is everyone will continue with their own chain ok so maybe greenchain goes for sometime bluechem goes for some time great and goes for some time but eventually after period of
MBA consolidation and one primary chain will be followed ok so this example is not debited right again the first class we have seen like the first or writing Course 2nd class in on the 2nd class first half we have seen that ok so that it is depicted very cleanly ok so after period of time it will all consolidated to am insane OK then the question arises like what happened to the other chain okay other chain
nether blocks were formed what happened to that those all blocks go as an art and blocks so it was it was thinking that it was a potential block and it was all going through suddenly some main chain has been you know it became successful so the all other blogs what it goes is it courses in of unblock it go session and confirm transaction ok and again that he'll have to be mine mind OK so that is so the network at just so moment you see the
this is not going to happen I like you know this one block it's not going to stay on forever so this network adjustment overall it takes like in 1815 minute sometimes makes half an hour within that the network will get adjusted ok ok wait any questions on this so shall we move on
so these are the things like ok so maintain maintain and secondary change so probly what do you know instead of looking at this I would recommend all of you to look at the second if it is in the first module UK second half we have done that in a look at the recording of the module it's even better so these are main chain secondary chain is temporary chain which gets warm but eventually it get it will get dropped off now let's concentrate
more than this mining concepts of and block is nothing but the blocks that I left out suddenly you know the main chain is formed so all other blocks will be in it'll go to unconfirmed transactions and then again we get mind so you finally it's a longest chain ok so now will look at this is modulus dedicated for this actually will look at this
so now if you look at the mining and the hashing rise what happens is as shown you in block number one ok the difficulty level was just one and right now the difficulty level we are billions ok so it keeps on increasing okay due to this solo mining is no more efficient and insert more than efficient it is not feasible it all to be a solo minor ok so no one has to move to a concept called
Maa pulled me ok fine ok so this all difficulty rice how it was way back how old is 1 and how it is going inertia pictographic Lee graph why is it is represented ok ok so what I'm going to do is give me a minute so I will take a note pad so this is going to be important
please OK in case if you are going to do pool mining sometime ok this is going to be important for you plus 2 listen ok ok there are many types right now so wonders payment in pool mining that is payment mechanism ok how they are going to then
HP printer is hardcopy plns I believe PPS okay PPS paper share and other ones paper last inches these are the payment mechanism ok so let us find let's go to blockchain that inform find out like what is the recent who has mind it ok so let us know I am going to
just block 5 14035 we can even find out like who is the winner btc.com ok I'll find something else so this one is btc.com so these are all the miners ok I'm just looking for some see you can look at and pull ok so let us say that
antpool mining company full mining company ok so this is our mining company ok so let's take in our class only we have a Jacob Dennis Mohit ok Rupesh soul of you want to participate in this pool mining thing ok so what you are done is
apart from this is there are many people in the network want to quit so my name is not feasible or not possible anymore ok so that is why people are going to the pool so what happens is so everyone so Jacob then is what they are doing a showcase is initially the result of the make a contract that you know will be with you for so won't show time period and all those details they finish after that what happens and moon and full will give you
software to be installed in your machine ok so bees before that your machine also would be Inspector to find out that whether you have Reliance relevant hardware to participate in the money ok suppose we take that the software startup ok so what happen is so everyone installs this stratum software in their machine so this is random software this is random softwares every and install startups of startup software in this its ok
now so you all have a hardware ok so JK Pur spend 50k worth of it ok then Asus 100 ke and husband 200k ok and 302 you spend so much of amount on hardware ok and everyone wants to participate in the money you have install the software and you are all set ok and you want to mine now what happens is
so this paper insurance paper paper last year and shares or in a way of payment mechanism ok how this payment mechanism works is so there are moment you get a block OK what happens is you get a block candidate block you frame candidate block and then what happened so this block will be sad to the suppose this and pull company has found
Candid block number 25 for example OK then what will happen is everybody will start to mine ok but just imagine that so if all of your mining if you all of your mining together ok so your using all suppose you have chosen has power so its 8 mm Dinosaurs 2000 as per usual hai
and 3000-4000 so put together how much 4000 7000-10000 has four we have ok for this network with this amount of hash power bi you know this and moon and papaya mining company starts me when I say mining what you do is so many how how long it takes it takes 10 minutes ok
Canvas you'll have to mine ok so in this case what happens this blog ok one has to find a non so you can see you can find the norms from one to hundred ok or you can find to to you know your not number could be in one to hundred or it could be in 1812 200 it could be anything ok so based on that this stratom software install right so it will tell you like you know you
this piece ok from 1 to 100 you substitute nouns Dennis you have been allocated with 181221 it okay movies with something Rupesh is something so everyone will be allocated some kind of list of non skippable have to try ok so that also will be taken care by software ok so we need not do anything manually so that is why the startup software comes into picture and it will take care and each of you know you are not going to
Innova jacket he needs to do if he has been given one to hundred ok he will be only working for one to hundred he doesn't care whether he solve solving the puzzle and what he does he doesn't care about that you know you keep work you keep working first one to hundred notes similarly Dennis has something Mohit and Rupesh all of you have something to work for OK then at the end of it ok at the end of it suppose
En Aasai Machan Tera to concentrate 1 yrs paper answer ok this paper NCR means it doesn't matter if you're all work together and solve the puzzle or not ok since I worked for so much time Since you worked for one to hundred you will be given a payout OK so far is let's say that one to hundred you are given $100 for example ok so then I have spend so much offered he gets
RCA Dennis has power so much right and I spend more has 4 because they both I should not be rewarded same because his machine configuration is superior to Jacobs 50 kms in West 100 K so probly he gets $200 ok sir likewise most gets $400 something like that ok when he gets $800 rupees is $800 this is how it will be paid out but important thing to be no
does the name suggests vaporeon sir whatever is your sir whatever amount you are working for utilising your hardware you get a share you get paid immediately OK so that is you know the way this pool mining paper and cervix and the others block is have not this and put this block 25 is meant by some other mining company still you will receive a payout UK suppose
25 inch ok this block 25 and cool beans in a still you will be getting the same pay out it's not like you know since this is one this 12.5 Bitcoins into half and you will get some portion of it doesn't work that way okay this model of payment pay for the entire model of payment it will give you only for the sharing work for OK I will take on questions
let's questions anything whole pool mining anything is fine let me know are there any money bill pools in India I don't I don't think so but I could be wrong OK most of this mining companies are from China ok mostly from China questions from JSON even if
lose you get paid that's right so it is like more of like you are working for your whatever is given to you you work ok you are not care about whether the mining company wins or not you have hardware you start working towards it but Jason so Gayatri can a person share change at any point of time That depends
so that all depends upon your agreement and how much hardware you have based on that every change Ok so any other questions others rupees 10 is no no it's any any questions
yeah you will look into paper last 10 years but before that if you have any questions or let me know clarify and then want to paper class 10 sir
ok fine so I don't see any questions problem jumper 2 paper last inches ok so paper last census is different commitment so you look at paper last inches here the commitment is different commitment is you are committing in such a way that ok so I will participate for
so I will participate supposed Jacob ride will take the same example ok so they all have this same startup software OK so the ideas jacobson of the Contract contract says you will have to work for next 150 blocks ok or thousands blocks so this is the show you'll have to work ok so you can join any day but the moment you join
I have to work and you know you'll have to work for next 2000 blocks okay and you'll be rewarded besan that so Dennis he can also join me anytime so he can work in 200 blocks whatever it is he can work only for 200 blocks let's move it wants to work for 3000 blocks okay and say rupees 400 blocks whatever it is this for you all makeup
interact with the company that you know I am going to work for you for next this money number of blocks ok but here the payment mechanism of you will not be paid out immediately OK so you'll have to wait 3000 blocks okay after 2000 blocks you will know that that is what you have accepted for SAP MM block you in how many blocks are 1 and how many has how much has for used based on that you will get calculated
and you'll be paid out it'll be paid out only if your mining company wins Bitcoin ok in the previous thing with other women or not they pay you ok it doesn't work work the same way in this you know the paper last 10 size paper class 10 shares works on like you know whether in that share ok and the accepted block number from 2002 to 2012 part of it if yes how much has Pagli as per your views based on that your paid out
send this case if you see Rupesh has only 100 blocks okay signed up for hundred doors luckily luckily enough EP is so he is part of in that hundred blocked here is mining company has solve the puzzle OK then he gets Asha sweet is based on that in a based on winning Bitcoin it is in a that save it is paid out so if you look at between both
class 10 shares paper paper share the more that means the more money you can receive using this paper last inches ok but it also has has this luck favour that should be a beer some luck ok but paper shares it doesn't matter with you win or not you get a paycheck as in when you complete your portion
go to guess questions questions Subhash sultani
Sudhanshu Sandeep Rupesh Sukanya week are we good ok
snow question for now ok so these are the types of coal mining and so difficulty target so they have some in pool mining right how much you have solved based on that day also just atem software I'll take care of like you know how much you have done this targets how you meet your targets it will be taking CAT by that
not go deep dive into it so here basically if you see around you see all these computers are connected together and they all work for the common solution so guys yes we are almost end of may we are done with this module
you probly what I am going to do this I can you know I am not going to start the next module what I would do it I'll just you know quickly scan through this eatery I'm so next module like what you need to be ready with so that you know it'll be easier when you coming to the next class ok so till now what we have learnt till the last class it's all fine ok it's all about Bitcoin okay overall you get an idea what a smart contract
is blockchain what is bitcoin now we will look into the real blockchain platform so sweet name is the first platform we will look ok again as mentioned there will be some theory like you know how this one works are home it is different than Bitcoin some basic terminologies will have to know and it is in a we have a look that account base model review th2 base model right so this one is account base model look at the
extensively will have to know JavaScript or no disturb Java libraries also but most of it is in JavaScript right now so will look at the programming concepts ok so this is what we will look it in the look and the next class there is a lot to go through in the next class next week ok so
no not a problem if you have time just go through one's about solid yellow theory we can discuss programming some time some white feel it difficult to grasp ok just go through one's yeah JavaScript is part of prerequisite that's right so Dennis lekin are you trying to get into programming
then I think you know if you are not getting into programming what you can even everyone has their own path right so probly you can look at the concepts and just ok this is a smart contract work you can think of a business solution or something like that ok ok find that's why I am not a problem
you can connect the dots lekin how things are going to work so there is a question from Gayatri any installations to be done before next class 3 even next class also we are not going to use any will do some solid ITI basic programming I'll show you how to do ok BM will be useful from the 6th
I think so no jason's install it think so ja node is required so any general questions or anything related I think done with all theories so any basic questions about blockchain or any anything you want to share I cannot meet you
6 classes next week yes and any any such any suggestions recommendations
ok so bad next class right let's start to know I don't know if if if everyone is OK to join before half an hour I don't have a problem in a like this like how we did this week so how about others can I get like a number can we all joined before half an hour no its not a mandatory requirement let me know if you want to join before half an hour I am good I will take
majority ok so majority say sorry can join so for some people its early let's stick to it ok so people have their own work and then install scheduled so I don't want to disturb you know in case if you want to catch up then probly will have to come early there is no that choice ok
because we all are from different background some could be freshers and experienced so so next class will meet at 8 so after that you will see like our things goes and then we can change it ok so any other questions let me know
snakes class is going to be it ok not no change in the timing as per ride Uric us timing if you have any questions you know do ping me in WhatsApp group so I'll be your crying if you have any questions
ok guess so we are good I think then we can break and get done with the class today 20 minutes early but if you have you don't have any questions your WhatsApp link and share probly what are you doing so silent I am going to send
me my number ok just ping me I'll add you to the group ok yes thank you for your time have a good weekend thank you all
