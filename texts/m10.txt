good morning guys are you all able to hear me see my screen ok good
Superstar new boys very few participants let me take up questions so good with the questions are going free after this blockchain which is a best 21 to learn hypnotism mongo DB
Naam best I would say node JS the reason not able to carry a JSON is not able to hear me how about others give me a minute let me pink Jason
ok ok fine yeah you know there is a better I know that mongo DB is fine if you ask me related to blockchain ok so blockchain all the ap ap is node SDK which are coming in most or not so it's better to learn to JSON
blockchain perspective ok and sweet what is your question you are good ok fine ok so others having any questions so I see we have only 5 partitions
let's Q another 5 minutes for students before that if you have any questions we can clear up yeah go ahead Jason what is the question let me know if I need to Unmute you should be fine
hello
this is the deploying network to hyperledger Fabric give me a minute let me go through that
sorry voice is breaking still its breaking reason when you can you can you ping me I can answer
OK so the question is what exactly are we doing in the step ok fine so what exactly you know what is happening as previously chillstep 17 ok still step 17 it was all what we have done it in the evening you know using module 7 we have created participants we have tested and all the stuff ok button
write an actual Hebbal hyperledger fabric network so how we do that is so basically Bass by running this took this command ok composer network deploy what is the buses in this case what does is we have not set up any real time environment as its ok instant what happens all the tools and stuff like that are installed in your machine ok so whatever is required to base
what is happening inside things that your machine has a pear your machine has a pear and order and then it goes ahead and deploy that ok so that is what is happening here
musician edit that command work for you ok so what is docker PS command do here ok so what happens is once you deployed hear your ideally if you look at your business network definition OK it is a combination of both you have written some JavaScript and details with the time so it is a combination of enoch smart contract and business network definition ok so all the smart contracts or think
whatever you're right ok it will deploy did it is deployed in a container ok to be deployed in a container so what happens here is moment you spin up when you say deploy in go ahead and deploy my business network definition what happens is it takes your be any file business network definition file ok which has both know it has this definition plus your smart contract combination actually
is a combination of both ok so chaincode is nothing but we are night and not writing any goal and see code but we use JavaScript combination of this both is spun it is together hosted in a container that is what is happening here so that is a doctor, where it is in a hostel is a container using a docker container
maksons fine so there were other questions should you a question from Sudheer for example multiparty incentive mechanism trust except ra how to deploy an SAP what are the three to four
main criteria one needs to take into consist let me Unmute you Justin Bieber let you go it's Sudhir can you brief a question relating use case on blockchain so yesterday I talked about and use case with your word using it within the organisation so just to extend on that what are the three or four men
materials that you take a look at it alright if it's good for blockchain for example like a study you said if the multi-part is involved then it might consider like 4 or 5 Bullet points that one need to take into account when you are getting any idea first one is multi party okay multi party and even in this multiparty will have to find out are there any dispute ok
dispute settlement issues say suppose if we take this BMW example for an hour or BMW example so what happens is steering wheel is manufactured by different vendors and then it gets assembled in the BMW ok so then what happens once the trust factor right so BMW trust that they have some quality params they also model parameters by that with the inspect and check it
Sudheesh values its all multiparty multiple vendors now they think that for a customer to experience in feel good factor and also in the same time real time settlement yeah what they use another no like no what's going on then and then we'll have to say that ok that could be probably tomorrow there would be some disputes are in terms of quality that could be something I need to order it okay continuously
in that case also this becomes a good one ok so multi party and another thing is you find immutability ok so blockchain is immutable so once you return is written so that should be a strong requirement for immutable its not be like I can change something sometime or something like that
other and another thing like you first of all customer should be willing to change Ok so that is important so if willing to change and another thing is right so that should be it should not be the case like you you can have a database and do all the stuff together ok whatever you if you want she is there is only one period in a very less number of participants
and you can accomplish everything with the database then it is not required you'll have to look at the holistically will have to look at the environment see whether this in your table nature is required always will have to question whether can I achieve this with a database ok so that it with the database by setting some permissions ok if it is some completely out of your control then blockchain is a good fit that most of the things that I say like today when
Faisal that come out not the major ones the other ones most of them can be address to database rights racing essentially multiparty immutable are the two main things with your mum utility to make things thanks thank you if there is a question from
Thani destination yeah so the new movie project I've uploaded in you no module 6 if you go to module 6 ok so here so I've uploaded prob yeah see here sample project movie ok under module 6 you can find this details
find and model questions ok so fine now let's golden
all of you have you completed this exercise or are you in the last step ok I get the message from Shailendra that the last deployment step failed how would Jason about others have your completed suggestion did you also face the error or was it working for you that
payment command ok Shailendra just say let me take your machine remotely and see like what's going on
can you show me ok try to run that again what is happening around the whole command look like
Sanjay ok so that is ok for you can either period when I finish
so how about I just didn't feel for you or you haven't tried can I get a Quick yes or no
collapse
just wait for a minute see what happens and then will see you question from bro
mongo DB what kind of information will be said it is more or less I like a no key value store and you can store JSON objects directly in mongo DB ok for development purposes right now it is very easy joins and other joints those are going to be difficult difficult ok but it's a whole another database it's not like in a flat and the structure like you can have so many columns in Som
heroes not like that you can have different columns you can have 10 columns in one row in another column can have 8 columns ok so now can you do more of this composer locks Shailendra can you type in more
more more Amore composer iPhone locks Richa directory ok can you can you go into CD into the directory CD composer locks type palaspe 7 ltr
Shailendra visit when you sometime during the break time sometime we'll see ok let's not let's not stop here sometime it may take some time to figure it out so let's do it in the break time of something that ok so love you right so what we were doing yesterday is so modulate so we followed all the steps like most of the steps first used
Ishwar creating the business network RK ok from from the existing network so what what we did us so this one this one download few the sample version this will download this command which is which is mentioned here right so this download the sample network from sample network via modifying all the parameters okay does as equal and as create
new business network what we did in a module 7 after creating it so what we do it change the relevant files all the composer from model files your changes a JavaScript file permission file permission related files all those files we have changed ok and then we are creating something called archive so that is composed of these are all changing colour changing steps
so what we do here is ya hear what we do here we are creating RK out of it shows nothing but a Zip file out of it so that is nothing but this archive will be name does not be any business network RK so now the archive is ready so they basically what we do if we are just importing SRK without composer playground and have created some basic participants and other things and make sure that things are fine
Where are also making a transaction after verifying all those the final step was to deploy so deploy where we're going to deploy is not on the playground or not not locally instead we want to deployed in the real fabric network so that is what we're trying here at the end if you see so this is where we deploy is the command
okay composer network deploy and what is that your friend reply your archive ok and I fun phl FB on this is nothing but hyperledger fabric version 1 ok and we tell that itself from where I deploy deploy your deployment from submarine from a machine ok this machine your calling it is an Admin and then you are sending some random string using all these parameters you are trying to deploy you from your machine
so this is what so this what is happening probably maybe can you try the steps Shailendra ok if its not getting deployed go into fabric tools and start fabric dots cell and then come and diploid again
ok sorry yes actually I had you Shailendra machine as a president so I didn't share my screen give me a quick minute ok
sudharma in Andhra like two three steps have done first is creating an Arcade I hope your able to see my screen first one is creating a business network okay ok so this is
nothing but the B NFL ok so when what is composer playground used for you can play around locally Oakley we can do some stuff ok finally what what is good happen is you are going to in this case what we have done this my iPhone network not be any this is our keep this is the one we have created now we want to go ahead and deploy this in a fabric environment ok so if you look at the fabric environment so these these are the commands
ok so what we do is this the command composer network deploy and what is that you are going to deploy whatever I gave you created iPhone phl everyone this is nothing but hyperledger fabric version one ok and I shall I fear admin so what this means is from the machine from the machine you're trying to deploy right you are saying that this is a pm
is it this is a fear of department machine and you are passing a random parameter so this is what is happening so this should get deployed in a fabric so normally in the real time environment what all you can do is you can compose you can do you remember we have created participants and all like a trader one trader to all those who can create here network create you can create add participant
you can do that you can submit transaction all those details you can do via command line also why rsbk create not submit transaction all those details you can do so the way you could do is you can either you so silly it is command line interface or you can user composer SDK
use any one of these and then you can deploy your network make sense ok guess so you know that shit about it just give it a try if it's not working let me know Shailendra just drive easy steps also maybe your fabric wasn't running so just run that and then get it right next
call of you can see this sample project here Kanda module 6 there is a file called go to the course content and the course can we can season the call sample project fine now there is something left out in hyperledger fabric will look at that and in today's class we are going to look at multichain that is a whole another platform new platform so will look at what is that platform and will be so probably will
but like half an hour and 40 minutes of period then rest of the class will look at practicals of it now its Shailendra what commands do you need
ok
so now we are going to look at some details of what is this hyperledger fabric what what we have learnt we have already we had some brief session of about what is this fabric and now we will develop into more details of that can be used in details by the way it is so beneficial why do we need to have hyperledger fabric some platform like apple UK the first one is the first. If you see it is the MSP ok membership Pro membership service provider so
normally if you look at your ethereum or Bitcoin world what happens is anybody can go and take an account so we were able to download the other day we were able to download ajax wallet and we were able to create our own address right so we are allowed to do that ok make sense but here in the permission world it's it's it's not be like anybody can participate so that it should be some constraint over like who can participate and who cannot party
so that whole thing is orchestrator using this membership service provider this is basically nothing nothing but using your certificate hierarchy like you know what happens to your websites which has https so it might require some certificate right certificates you get it from verisign or other authorities where you used the certificates and make sure that your website is a trusted website similarly in height
fabric the same concept on ocean is taken ok and does certificates are being issued to the particular user so post JSON is appear and he supplies are you supply steering wheels to BMW he needs a certificate ok in today's world what is happening is you all we all get a password right we login and we create a password but that's not the case with hyperledger Fabric in fabric world you need a certificate why you need a certificate
is nothing but you with the certificate what do you get is nothing but you get a public key and private key so once you and you can encrypt with your private key public key and doors so that's why you get it but in the permission deflation in ethereum world You Can anybody can go ahead and created in fabric world someone like other network provider in this case BMW has to issue a certificate for Jason that voted
next one offers pluggable options here here what is happening is you can since it is a private permission network ok you are you can go ahead and pick and choose what algorithm you want to use what is that which will be suited to my organisation on my environment accordingly you can plug and play a different moduls even in case of MSB ok suppose you want to use fabric fabric is providing a CA
tickets a certificate authority is providing something called fabrics suppose you want to go to verify verisign ok because your existing organisation goes with verisign you want to go with that you are good to go ok so that is more of a pluggable suppose you are using by default What happens fabric you say something called bebe ft permission Byzantine fault tolerance network suppose you want to change instead of that consists of that I want to have something else that is also possible ok
and the last thing if you see it offers to ability to create channels that is in the public world all the transaction ever make the ethereum wallet if you make a transaction everybody in the world knows that from this address there is a transaction has happened against the smart contract or something like that where is in the private saying ok you can create a separate channel and make sure that that is not exposed to the outside world
all that is not exposed between competitive so that all can be taken career OK so the next 1 years
Sony questions here so the key benefits the key benefits more or less like other normal blockchain plan benefits okay data protection and consistency so all of your transaction is hatched ok so does all secured no one can time for the data ok and confidential transaction in terms of fabric so that use some if you want a specific
section between to be happened between only two or three parties parties that is possible in fabric not in the public blockchain and here you need not worry about cryptocurrency no cryptocurrency in aquarium if you want to transfer of you want to send some transaction you should have some others so that that will be taken as a gas cost to submit any transaction ok so here that's not required the last one is Programmable ok so we're
you can write chaincode you can write all your conditions and details in Chain code and accordingly you can take a benefit out of it that is Programmable and how it is different this is a how old is different from other blockchain so when you look at cryptocurrency its not required to network its not others anybody can join here only permission and peers can enjoy
next transactions ok transactions you can have our way you want ok here all these transactions are anonymous anonymous in the sense no one knows like you know what what's going on these transactions get there is a transaction from this particular address that's what people know who has initiated its not know but in the fabric world it's not that I know it is the owner of the network issue certificate so he knows that who is owning that
viklang certificate more traffic control facial consensus algorithm so Bitcoin ethereum both uses the proof of work which one has to spend a lot of enormous amount of time to find that calculation you by then get smiling robot here it is like a patient by Byzantine fault tolerance smart contracts
so in between that is nothing like smart contract in ethereum we have a smart contract here we call it as a change code ok so now capabilities what all hyperledger fabric can do for you it is more or less this one right whatever we have seen here so it's almost the same we are going to see what is the identity management ok all your user ID
instead of having a username and password normally what happens today is if you were suppose if you want to purchase from Amazon Amazon is a user based if you go to any private Marketplace and if you want to buy something in a hole like like in terms of detail something if you want to buy normally what you get you get a username and
password of that particular website but where are you do all certificates public and private key so privacy and confidentiality is taking CAT privacy basically using channels and using wire certificates it is taken care efficient processing why is sufficient pressing used because in a dream world it's all public chain ok we are we don't have control over like how many people are going to make a
section and apart from transaction what happens is there is a lot of time spent in Mining in Italy on world right so even though for if you look at a blog generation takes 15 seconds in fact in the Bitcoin world it take 10 minutes 15 seconds only one block is possible in 15 seconds suppose you want to go in the private changed world if you want to make a novice transaction
that will not be possible in fabric in fabric what you can do even one second once you can create a blog blog even you can create 20000 transactions inside one block all those are configurable so that's why it is efficient processing 420 chaincode functionality chaincode functionality is nothing but the smart contracts what is the business rules you want to enable in your network so those all can be converted into a chain code and then get
and final is a modular design so you need not change your complete system completely so you can even use your existing systems ok and integrate so this the modular design for next fabric model what all components are there pretty much it like whatever we have seen assets job in this case in our example what I said we have created an asset called
commodity where there is a commodity called ABC like that we update so we are allowed to create our own assets so this is possible and next is chaincode chain code is nothing but the business rules you want to interact with multiple parties so that is a chain code to ledger features so ledger features like a few min
what you can do if you can the queries right we have not looked into queries and all ok so what you can do is still it is in the fabric world it is easier to query ok in Italian world all will have to write the some get method and then you'll have to go in on that we get methods you're right I should write in smart contracts using that methods you have to query but here in fabric world you are storing into something like
CBR level DB ok some some details of it you can directly query it is easier to query the details for Channels I think we have talked enough about channels any question guys
Nokia CEO first security and membership services like controlled fashion like who needs to be in the network and who should not be so that is all controls on the consensus we know that here we can plug and play consensus it's more or less than a same thing CFC and this one this may be an another is an important part of participants in hyperledger blockchain network could be the
typical parties ok ok we have created a blockchain network ok a fabric environment we have deployed staying code and all the stuff who's going to use it and how a network will look like first one let's start from developer ok so developer need to create a application for a business party to business user to use it so first component to other compass certificate authority because everything here is based on certificates not
recover normal user id and password so there is a certificate authority here so that certificate thought so the next one is blockchain developer so he creates application deploy cigarettes application gives the chaincode ok network operator what he does is he is a hero he controls the network basically what the all the permissions and related so blockchain network operator he operates deploys and although
sorting CP cash so next one is so these three are them right then we are providing some interfaces for easy access one is access to data suppose you want to query some data and I have to store in some database ok there is provision made so that you can store some some of the change the details you can add to know your normal database structure so these are for
your end result ok ultimately it look good ok so you have different components attached ok it's not that every time you have to go query blockchain then access to logic traditional processing platforms also this one is critical process platforms nothing but suppose you have a built-in system or already a system is up and running a manufacturing unit
ok so but that one wants to integrate with your blockchain so that also will be enabled using hyperledger fabric and regulator regulating what regulator and compliance what happens when after a while they check that whether you are followed the norms and details ok so he will be another participant in the network and find out like what are the transaction who had what permissions it is very easy to track because the ledger is completely immutable Eva
if you want to add a participant that's going to be a transaction make sense okay question from shareit Silai can we access RDBMS here now RDBMS what I'm saying is suppose you have blockchain data and if you want to take this data and store it in database so those all feature
made easy made available in fabric so that you know it is easy to access so it is enterprise it is this platform is built thinking that it is used by enterprise so water bottle enterprise needs today so there's always taken care next show
busy. 6 architecture okay the following are the conditions of February public. 6 right now we are in one point one there is no more this act as many of it is not there we look at one point one also this one day of given explain explain about each entity ok so what what is that each entity explains we can go through that
and Fabric components to see what all things constitutes a fabric one is a ledger so immutable ledger where u store everything the next one is a smart contract so nothing but a chain code where you write your business rule how it should change the state what should happen when a transaction what should happen to us it suppose if you are creating an asset called purchase ok if you are making a purchase order so that has to go as a transaction so that as it connects is consensus
network so what is consensus network is typically who are going to validate your transaction and finally the certificates more or less we're saying the same thing so this important events so even so what is happening if you remember our ethereum world what happened for every transaction you make you can raise an event so whether it is successful whatever you want to capture in the event right
you are good to go in and you can caption so likewise hyperledger also provides this even facility just imagine like your computer right so you have installed Windows or whatever it was you have that would be something for event viewer so in this event we are what happens it will suppose it is it is blocked in some traffic so those are Laura generated as event or as simple as your battery your battery has some issues
and is capturing the pivot ok so what will happen if you go query your event viewer you can find out like you know what what has happened with my battery how many times does recharge down ok solve the sequence you can capture similarly that facility is available in fabric and sister management now we have something call hyperledger Cello using that you can deploy you can monitor how many transaction has gone all those details are possible using system management
and security security manager user credentials so wallet so if you see what happened in the composer playground all you create something like cards ok we have not seen that so sorry ok we have created we have given certificates and all those details right so how would the customer at the end user will use fabric he needs to give yours public and private key
how is that meeting so that also can be maintained in something like wallet so system integration system integration is also possible ok so if you want to bring a external system if you want to talk to blockchain that is possible ok but only thing is blockchain
techno what you still right till now blockchain cannot go ahead and talk to excel systems it was all like blockchain would operates on its own other systems can interface with it and find out what details it needs ok it's not bidirectional so that's what they mean by but why directions
ok sir next to next how do we how do we interact when we say fabric interactions all we have done till now was probly be executed some silly commands like composer deploy composer Arcade create these are commands we have you but ideal world no one is going to use only the administrator is going to use some Commandments right it's all going to be driven from UAE ok from UAE
there is a rich SDK available software development kit available so that one can query the blockchain one can find out like if he wants to change the state for some reason yes I'd rather wait for a while I'll send it ok so I speak so that is what is
used for ok so there is one which you can use from you I so all of you but like all of you know rest API is right so typical rest API is available so that you can query the blockchain find out what has happened you can initiate a transaction all those things you can do so this one
let's look at this one fabric architecture so what happens is so there is a level db so this is the level DB or fabric is allowing you to have couch BB also you can either have a level DP or gosh TV so this is here and then you have a blockchain where do you have all transactions and everything on top of it you can have a smart contract also or nothing but a change good so
let's ok so let's see like you know this is so in terms of blockchain developer what he can do ok so basically all the interactions what I want you to take notices for all those are coming via this SDK come here if you want to deploy there are EP is using which you can deploy if you want to query then using you know if we can query kiss all those details you
this application SDK you can do it make sense any questions so this all these St Catherine this becomes very important if you want to if you are working in terms of you know if suppose you know if you are only looking at the use cases and if you have a team to develop OK then this post
not be important to you but if your going to be a developer and an organisation that then these libraries are very important for you ok so you have to find out like how this is going to help because in the real-time world the architectural be looking that only do you know how to interact with us so that is what will be technically that is what will be looked upon
ok so next one is so now this is you see fabric 1.0 in fabric 1.2 what all we have we have this endorsement policies which we imagine right so we have this endorsement policies ok so plugging external identityserver the number too so this is nothing but
no its not that you will have to use only fabric SDK ok fabrics CA certificate he can use verisign another certificate authority whatever you use in your organisation the third one is external state db so previously there was only level TV support from version 1.0 they are included HD be supported on historical queries
shit what happens is if the events and other things they are categorised and they are stored in the database for you to easily me know or you can plug and play can store the DB store that in the database so that easily can do some queries on top of it historical queries ok so there is no direct hit CPP instead the you ask you to use the SDK If you are using node libraries you'll have to install this npa
modular ratio using Java I'll have to import the respective jobs and then start writing it chaincode upgrades so yeah previously what happened there was one chaincode suppose if you want to change the chain code suppose your logic is not right and if you want to change then I will have to deploy Nu Chain code from version 1.0 They brought in a feature called you can upgrade the chain group thing ok bye bye
number Chowki service I'm not taking it it's almost the same what we have seen channels are there certificate issuance so answer of Level didi 11 DB you also have something cause TB and so ordering service previously there was no order or ok so in the fabric 1.0 They brought in this order then the three
postman policies if you want to send a transaction you can set endorsement policies like who has to endorse for this to accepted for this transaction to get accepted all the details and this one is transaction lifecycle hyperledger fabric this very important so we have already seen it so this is nothing but you remember we have taken this example of
so we have taken this order appear as an example and each pair will be simulating a transaction you remember so that's the same is mentioned here probably I'll explain this ok so submit first one is submitting a proposal as simple as you sending a transaction
once you send a transaction give me a sec ok so you send a transaction what happens when she wants you send the transaction it has to go talk to the chain code or what are the test to do so in the example what we have seen we send a transaction it goes to peer and I'll have to simulated same thing is happening here so cute chaincode to simulate
proportional prepare whatever the transaction is received so that will be simulated for that simulation it will give you the result that result their calling it is read write set RW set is nothing but rewrite set so sense proposal and get response back so what we have seen here is this one will submit everybody will simulate and then they will send that to the Pier so that is a sin send proposal response back ok now order
service creates the battery service verify this and creates the batch of transactions ok and what the pierces sons order or what he does is Faraday's all the conditions like whether the endorsement responses write whether the read write said that I think we have taken that one no one example sides are 100 and 1 hours so everyone has given me the Retreat set is right or No 1 this is also fine now they all
she's a commit so before committing Peer validates once and then it is what is happening here any questions here so this the architecture let me know if you are stuck up or something I can explain again ok I don't see any questions solving
so these are different types of peers wonders are committing comet appear so committed was suppose here here we say that a leap year 2 and tier 3 Iron dosa ok so then all the pairs by default are committing PS will have to commit ok once a transaction on then we'll have to come it solve the pairs are committing peers but some beer can be endorsing Peer depending upon the policy you can set for 1 ampere
Tu or indoor simple piece so I can set that ok so The Last of Us ordering Pizza ordering also is an entity and its a machine so they are called I called as pairs their jobs to validate all the simulations whatever done by the pairs are right against the leisure water test and then distribute it make sense guys
are the next one is change code upgrade from version 1.0 the NIC mention there is change code upgrade it is nothing but previously Uni not you know he'll have to deploy for every small change you'll have to deploy the smart contract our new think would know you have a version number using that you can upgrade it make sense
fine guess we are done with hyperledger fabric so question from Shailendra so we can change the code and apply again that's right so we can change the code and apply what happens is the existing container whatever your existing container right so that container will get destroyed and then you
container will be upgraded with the new version number so many questions Rakesh Shri Subhash Sudhir any general questions also fine let me know
will take a break then while coming back will look at multichain soul take a break
I don't know for some reason I get this question popup window but I don't see any questions so I can anyone type and rowtype some yes or no some something like that in the question window I don't see any questions but I see pop ups
Rakesh Lavika can you type in NIOS on or something like that fine for some reason I don't see anything please say let's meet at 95 OK so the meantime let me log off and login
can I get a
now only I received all your questions so probly after the break you like you know I know
Hatim hope all of your back so I see this question from free how the licensing licensing work for fabric so it's open source
then what happened was in order to provide community support ok and release update patches and everything companies like cloudera hortonworks map for ok this companies came up so that they took the open source and they created a proprietary platform in the functionalities and all same but the give support so like why is here also there trying to get some for now it's all come
open source make sense so the next question from she did I answer your question can I get quick cash or no because you know there is some issues with a question window but yeah I guess so the next tour next question is from Sudhir so if hyperledger does not have a cryptocurrency then what is the use of wallet ok in this case
is more of storing your public and private key ok that is your certificates for every beer in fabric world for every beer or every user you get a certificate using that certificate you will have to communicate right so where do you store the certificate where is where do you store is public and private it's very difficult that you know I like the 16 or 32 digit number it is very difficult to write down all the study two digit number I so what are maintained the certificates so for that
Eenadu safely safe that private and public is a gift something like what makes sense a nose to hear it does not contain any assets good question 2 danfoss
Indra think you was looking for command commands just give me a minute let me show my machine I think your already able to see my machine
so I am going to do if there is a start command looks like it was not working for Shailendra let's let me quickly see that
shall I will get back to you on this for some reason I do you see is something called start fabric that sell your machine
ok Tim sailaja will I'll get back to you ok so let's all go into multichain 9th module
fine what is this multi channel give a quick intro
chain is nothing but a fork of Bitcoin okay the forecast Bitcoin so what happened was that out like in a bitcoin is great ok it works fine and all the stuff they thought like why can't we use multi chain in a why can't we create a platform to use if you look at Bitcoin Bitcoin be a bitcoin can be used
only for a bitcoin right so only one asset that is bitcoin we can't do anything other than that one option you have with Bitcoin as an option we have is nothing but in Bitcoin you have something called extra data UK you might have seen some projects and all in Bitcoin ok how their working is when you want to send a transaction or some details right
what happens if they have a fielder called extra data I think I don't the length of the field extra data ok so you can set some details here so there what they are using is there using this extra data field and then they are trying to develop some basic projects which can run on top of Bitcoin for example issuing certificate if you look at MIT think I'm it okay MIT from us right there
doing certificates on blockchain Bitcoin blockchain how this works is nothing but there using this extra data field and then they are trying to add some details ok ok fine so multichain what the tortoise ok Bitcoin is great but why can't we use it for other reasons for other assets so that so it was all create a multi chain ok so unlike very very very important. Ok this is the most important.
multichain if you look at it Hariom even chaincode they have something called smart contract right so smart contract is nothing but a Turing complete language you can have all this is condition if condition for loop all those things you you can have it and like that multichain is not a smart contract application multichain
no smart contract no smart contract ok instead all it as is some asset and permission okay so if you look at inter multichain it is more of a permission based ok for everything if you want to create a said there is a permission if you want to make a transaction to that I said you have a permission so the entire block changes controlled using permission based ok so that is
import permission and assets ok so using this only using permissions this multichain tip clearance ok and they have command line they have serial interface and also they have interest IPA IPA library available to interact with each other now
what the tortoise ok when I say fork of Bitcoin it is nothing but they took the Bitcoin source code ok and added some extra features and added some extra features and then there early something called multichain look at will Orissa high level and the coin and the team name is called an inclined sparks that also will we will see
so we'll see the history and also blockchain for enterprise their goal was to create one for enterprise which has no Crypto currency like Bitcoin but you can create different acids like what we have seen right yesterday we have seen an asset call some commodity like way you can create an orange shirt or any type of acidic and create millions of
you can create ok not a problem but no cryptocurrency there is no mining reward nothing like that is there and blockchain as a tool not ideology so here there are no smart contracts in things like that so there trying to use the feature like immutability OK you get immutability ok so different people have to participate different participants has to participate so that is taken care so they have their own Plus and minus is this report
collective admin collective administering but it is not one administrator who runs the network it is all based on permissions remember when I mentioned here permissions so anybody can set permissions that can be mutually agreed upon and then you go and build the network ok so that that's how it works then you have some dayquil designated - designated - is nothing but for in any Bitcoin
or any blockchain world someone has to validate this transactions ok so if you look at the traditional database world what will happen is there will be an administrative administrator user id and that is roles and privileges for each tables ok and based on that the integrity is maintained right you do I delete send update all those details when it comes to a blockchain since it's a distributed database or distributed ledger consensus has to be in place
okay consensus and minor some minor nothing but who validates transactions ok so here also there are designated - since it's a permission network they coin like who will have to be the - your it is for using for enterprise the idea is gold used for enterprise they can use this platform and the can build applications on top of it
so as I mentioned it was derived from Bitcoin Core software so where all it supports it supports and Windows Linux Max Mac and as I mentioned like you know it has to Interface IP is also there command is also there so that way you can easily interact with multi cylinder will see that fine
also next one is multi chain helping Enterprise in blockchain so their goal was to help enterprise create a blockchain platform so what all managed permissions this is important one so here if you look at blockchain here when you look at multichain everything and be permission if you want to add a participant that can be positioned if you want to add acid it can be position so I said if you want to make a particular try
section that can be permission okay and if two two or three people want to join the private and to that can be formation so dissolve manage permissions ok and Rapid deployment it is very easy to spin a network not like fabric Canal if you want to spin a pen at work it's a very pretty tedious task fabric writing a chain code is very easy
Harley if you practice for a we should be able to write saying good but to setup a network in maintaining creating all the certificates allocating to the user that's a big headache here this all things are very fast you can set up a spinner for network very fast okay Rapid deployment unlimited has its source emotionally can create millions of assets ok and track track the ownership
the things can be done and here there is another concept call data streams data streams you can I quit this to something like our messaging queue or if you are from in any of this big data other environments you might be knowing something like kafka ok so this is nothing but where you can you can create a common data source ok between machines you can create a data
scene where many people can write into that ok so if you look at let's compare this with the blockchain OK what happens with the typical ethereum blockchain as you make a transaction that transaction what happens that is field inside a block someone validate that that is a good course right should solve block by block here if you want to just create a channel and if you want to write something into that the data stream and other party can retrieve it it is as simple as
there is a common area OK where you write something whatever it is you want to write something suppose you write and name x y z something like that if you want to write it in the data stream you are good to write ok you can write and others you can you can provide permissions to this data stream so that others can retrieve from this device tree ok
should we located in over index will look into it ok so these are data streams so any question still here OK so the next one is so
this is how it was started in 2014 ok started by some company called coins Park ok they got this idea they started with multi Chain and right now we are in multisim 12.0 this there road map ok so end of 2019 they want to create something called multichain 3.2 so here the other disadvantage of multi chain is
ok it's a good good in certain scenarios but if you look at here since there is no smart contract ok so there is no condition based transactions it is like only permission based transactions so in many of the use cases require condition based transactions so what is happening is multi chain is in at least its not getting popular ok
like I'm here and off before year and half it was quite popular but right now its its losing its light Bitcoin to private blockchain so this is basically if taken the source code is taken from Bitcoin right and then moved on to private blockchain ok so what are the features
we'll see all those so this should have taken in a disco in Spark company they are so this coins for company has on top of Bitcoin they have done something else also ok and coins using coins Park protocol I am not very sure of what they have done ok so then at that time only they got this idea why not create a
Innova completely new platform for enterprise so that so its all started and they are using Bitcoin as a protocol underlying architecture it is bitcoin only thing the handshake process is different I'll show you that so it can act as a note on the regular Bitcoin wallet so it means suppose if you are if you are having a multi chain platform and if you're running a multi chain suddenly if you want to convert your multichain node into a bitcoin node so that is possible because it
show all written using Bitcoin dried you are using a bitcoin Court protocol you have changed that so they have given that ability so that you can you not can act as a bitcoin noodles so all the Bitcoin related commands is allowed here on top of that all new comments are also they are provided ok so now the aim of multichain so the aim of multi chain
I want to create a blockchain for enterprise that is the one so the next one is all based on permissions to control over transactions are permitted ok and in terms of mining they want to get rid of all the pitfalls whatever problems and pitfalls which Bitcoin has they want to get rid out in a get rid of it when it comes to multichain cuz multichain is purely for private
under the handset handshake process so this is a important one I'll show you what is so handshake process how does it work is so this is machine a is machine b
ok so everyone has a list of like permissioned who all can participate they have this list ok the same list is he also has a list baby also having a same just ok so post here in the permissible list that is P and there is a public key of let's say that
name and public key name is nothing but b and public is eric's 123 ok so now what happens is now be wants to communicate ok communicate with a b is our first how the handshake happens is BA has to
trust ok B is a note which I know ok what will happen is a will send a suppose it say hello message ok so it sends hello message encrypted be possible we will initiate something and yeah ok I need to know who you are then in that case what happen it will send hello message for example some random Street ok so it will encrypt using 20 public key
encrypt using be public ok now what will happen is this result this result we will be getting this result so now what you happen is since it is encrypted using 20 public key only be knows its private key ok so it'll and encrypt or decrypt sorry decrypt using
BB will private can send back the result so now I can compare that and make sure that yes ok he wants the private key you know he is a legend part is 1 so that is a handshake process so that is so they all the permissions and how it works is placed on this ok so its first in a that's what they are mentioned here is not present suicide entity as public address on the permitted list ok so every
one maintains the list like who is identity and what is the public is ones that is there is no senses challenge message so that is in here we are sending a challenge message hello so that seems like a signature ok well have to open that then then send it back so by that way it is made sure that it is a right participant suppose if she claims to be like in MB
Nashe Si is acting as B then not lapinus am hello message would come to see see you not able to do not be able to decrypt because he does not have the private key of B make sense any question guys
I can I get some yes or no because I don't know sometimes my question was not working so just want to make sure to be super skinny all ok I get a message that's good Sudhir like can you give some popular project using multi chain
so there was one project was ok Rajasthan was Rajasthan over Indian Rajasthan come see nothing when it comes to blockchain nothing is product in the first one thing what are you remember or have came to know that Rajasthan government right so Rajasthan government over there doing his for women empowerment OK what they do is like a like a n e
state government their issue weaving ppvs okay televisions and other other benefits to the customers ok and all these are tracked by ration card and other details so they wanted to use a blockchain platform to track this is it ok if it is a television which has to go to person in in Rajasthan for household and
Sansad wanted track this so for that in fact they did a lot of testing using multisim Ok another the smart contract was not necessary in their case to solve mostly like you know if I create a television just track like where it is everyone will be formation and they want to track each each Panchayat Union will be having letters appear they want to INR
make sure that the transaction has happened and finally every individual right every individual so in every woman will have a special identity some like Aadhar card they have this special number with that they wanted to track whether it has gone to them or not this one thing and other examples all typical examples are gift cards so those are all tracked using multichain just
with questions from silencer FC will have private chain of private yeah yeah that is possible if she is having a private key of B and C can do but ideal scenario that should not happen until under SBI shares is private
why use cases of multi chain so it is a lightweight financial so that we cannot use this for in a cross border payments or even Here they think provenance tracking so this is also it has failed no ok II. Us trailer provenance tracking is nothing but if you want to track the assets okay throughout like in so what you have
basic SAP contract ok like from one place to another that you can track but say that most of the time what happen is it will have some kind of a condition OK when you want to track she just imagine that suppose payment is not made then I will not in a transfer the said so there maybe conditions ok so that's why multichain
is not used widely since there is no smart contract ability so lightweight financial transactions suppose if customer purchase something from Amazon UK immediately he gets award. So these all can be easily then why are multi Nexus for inter organisational Record Keeping so there is no smart contract all you need to do is
moment you get some details you'll have to store it in the same then then in that case also multichain is a good one so multi change permissions in Aise mentioned in the Notepad like enough permissions are the main thing right so all these you see these are different variety these are just films of it ok one can connect to the network this can be permission who can connect send and receive transaction can be formation who can write 288
who can issue assets who can create streams who can unlock cell change everything is all permission okay can all set the permissions and based on that you can interact with the chief ok so next is multi chain assets so when when we talk about assets in multi chain there is no smart contract as we mentioned before
there is no smart contract flexible asset metadata meaning that you are said you can have millions of metadata and I'm sorry millions of Assets and your metadata can be anything you can have a look inside a loop if you look at your structure of solid ITI ok you have some limitation you have some structure you have mapping here it is not the case you can create any type of asset
permission to follow on insurance is issued it is all attract based on permissions if you have permissions what you can do to dataset atomic multi-asset payments so it is suppose if you want to trade ok if you there is a set in or whatever we tried in the module 7 and 8 fabric sweet is atomic cities that is same two person cannot update the sad at the same time that at all
what is taken care like how you do it in database so multiway atomic asset is changes so different people can an act on the same asset and it can be transferred multi signatures for security supposed security and risk this is also important suppose you think they are trying to establish smart contract like this using this different permissions for example
for example I will give an example I need to transfer $10 to Sudhir ok up on some condition ok so simple example is today morning I wake up at 6 o'clock I will have to transfer $10 to Sudhir ok so what they do is normally this can be done by a smart contract smart contract you go morning 6
look like you end up make a signature something like that you can do it in smart contract here what happen is if I want to do a condition is $10 has to be transferred what I should do it immediately I wake up I will make a signature that you know 6 o'clock I woke up I make a signature then there is another party was to agree because we both myself and Secure cannot been an agreement ok because we are
then that can be an escrow other party Multistrada party ok I agree that yes you have signed it I agree to it and that way another $10 then get transferred based on functions they try to achieve the same thing so I'll subscribe to our set query transactions so when you look at an acid they'll be lot of details if you take a simple say like orange
ok so that may be number of quantities you can carry what is the quantity who wants what what is the balance of it like ways you can query those assets and find out lot of details so multichain streams ok so maybe look that you can either create asset to think you can do here in multisim OK what are the two things one is your creator set you create a set
so this name as it is awesome plus you create something like so you create the type of asset is true or not if you want to take a real time use case lipstick that Rajasthan example for example ok type of an asset TV okay so quantity Max quantity out
mm ok and other the specific detail detail colour TV ok and so on and so forth we can add that the digits is an asset to the other one is a data stream in data stream what you can do you can create some data so there is no I said but you can create and add some data on the stream ok
suppose let's say that I want to be a good example suppose your organisation you want to all the incident tickets you want to add it in the data stream simple example of insulin tickets so this one you can incident ticket say like today that was CA
8123 CA to CS3 solve this can be added here ok so like data staying here there is no I said like you know what is the fixer like now what is the time you are not defining it but instead you're doing something else Ok so multichain streams okay general data retrieval so basically what it does is you're right into steam and it will
immutable same concept would you do if you don't define something when it comes to our side you define this is these are going to be the feels so here what do you do as you see so these are the three types of things we can do a key value database or a document store in the style of nose equal it is a key and value type you can do so for example CA ticket one you had the details ok so like this you can create a stream at times
is database which focus on ordering of entries as simple as suppose you want to find out the time series data right in that case what will happen let's take that you want to calculate employee time in timeout ok employee time in swipe in time cannot find out so likewise you can create a steam so as and when someone enters the organisation so they will be given
Mere timestamp okay hundred employee ID assented at time 9:43 a.m 9:43 a.m ok 200 employee no not one employee so that like we can do this another one and identity driven database where employees are classified according to their author so that is now we have some segregation like let's say that if you want to define some group
ok let's say lessons so Leo Tolstoy books ok so if you want to all database some details if you want to add some books OK then you want I had some Dan Brown books so some something like that you can have you want to go with the department wise so Finance Department you have a hierarchy and then you had some details
likewise different types of stream in depending upon your use case you can create a common seems this doesn't have an asset but instead you can create a some kind of a data store where it will be easier to fetch query in a right in picture details so is so when we look at the stream so what all are the characteristics of a stream so
so suppose if I create something this has to be digitally signed by someone if I create myself ok so it is employee sign in verification and alright so someone has to verified if I create something and 10 others to retrieve so there is also fine that's fine but you can also make digitally you can sign something like you can make sure that two parties sign to make that as a data stream you can create all those permissions
optional key for convenient later retrieval so basically this environment is for rich showcase ok we can you give a query and gain suppose if you want to get a Leo Tolstoy books all books and you have we have a ID one and against one you have a no one stands for Leo Tolstoy ok all his books are under 1 then it will be easy for you to retrieve an optional key
so how much data can contain can contain up to 64 MB I believe you will see that which can reach from a small piece of text to many megabytes of data so that much of data it can have and also you can Hawa Hawa timestamp ok question still here so this early
how do we retrieve those details from string OK what are the ways you can retrieve using lucky you are you can choose an order publisher different things when we look at a practical you will know like you know what what we're trying to the next one is consensus model OK Here consensus model is simple it is a permission network so what they do is they go for
can decide it is always turn around Robin fashion Round Robin fashion suppose there are 10 in the network we can say that you know first number one next it goes to number 2 number 3 number 4 and so on and so forth so that's a good work so they are called validators somaina Zaheer Tum does validators what they do they look for the transaction basically they will find out whether the permissions are aligned with what we have configured
so that is done and then that's how it works ok so here there is no proof of work there is no cryptocurrency nothing like that but you can create a token suppose if you want to create whatever we have seen right so we have created a set of type TV so like why suppose if you want to create a setup your own coin something like that you want to create some koinex then you can create a quantity in May
that is fine as there is no intrinsic currency where you can cash out nothing like that ok so multichain uses a Round Robin we have seen that and the concept of mining diversity which is configurable it is like suppose you know you can determine like this mining is all configurable meaning that there are 100 participants in the network
and you keep waiting for so long that you are not receive the block that that cannot happen so those all things are configurable here so my that is called mining diversity here I think they are not mentioned that send my money diversity can say that you can set like I need 30% of blocks to be all the city conditions you can set ok
multichain flexibility so this is mostly I write this 45 + blockchain parameters with you this is the one of the court thing when we talked about permissions here you know we talked about permissions and assets right so we can have very few of permissions in multisim so and there are a lot of parameters are there you can configure ok can change
according to this are those parameters 45 + blockchain technology is very easy platform there is nothing to do with it like there is no mining there is mining but it's Round Robin fashion pretty much easy stuff only thing is will have 2 depending upon the use case needs will have to tune in this 45 + parameters ok so you can change the permissions over time ok so all these can be done any questions feel
are you getting high level idea of what is multi chain can I get a Quick Kesar know so deployment options ok so deployment as options like we have seen and Fabric right so you can use a data centre that is
if you if you want to use it in your private environment in your machines you are good to go if you want to use iCloud it's your good to go ok or if you want to use the last migrate accessed as a service that is suppose if you want to use like metamask you remember metamask we use metamask is nothing but a light client wallet where your transaction all those periods are outside but all you do is just send some initial using your public and private key you make some transaction likewise
can do your shoulder ride from Bitcoin so if you look at Bitcoin today we used Jaxx wallet and I should your other wallet like 110 what does is it maintains blockchain you are not oning the entire near not holding all the blocks but still you are in a week and security communication thing can be done here not sad at simply and quickly ok it's very fast and I will see that
search very fast hip cleanly separate SAP from node so since there are APS Uni not even Run full not that's what timing you see here in devices you can see mobile ok can have a mobile wallet you can have different machines and then you can interact auric if you want to run full know that is also possible security in multichain ok it's all
based on Bitcoin utxo based model it's not a state the account base model theory I'm a second base model Bitcoin S utxo model they've use the same model here only thing the consensus algorithm of the mining algorithm has changed so otherwise it's pretty much it's the same UK since we are using Bitcoin we know that Bitcoin how safe it is we are using it for around like 8-9 years right right now so 10 years almost
saying that it is secure and full multisignature support that also we know like if you look at Bitcoin if you want to initiate a transaction and if you want to enable multi say it is possible that is it goes to one person he has to sign and next person science only then let us out to the network so that is possible here so external key management Bitcoin hardware security module so it is nothing but
so since you know that Bitcoin uses hardware wallet and allied basically the chain blockchain will be stored outside main elsewhere and using interface ok you can using a lightweight that you can try to the same thing can be applied here also it's pretty much same consensus over data not execution ok so it is fully on assets it is like assassin
Christian based model ok that's about the security so what all are the benefits benefits it's all in a RC mention it solved configurable so in Bitcoin world if you see that is only blocks can be generated once in 10 minutes
yeah it's not the case you can see you can and also the Bitcoin world you see that there is only a heart size limit there is only a 2 MB or 3 MB of size can only be a block and if you want to change beyond that then you will have to go for a hard 424 K10 create something but here it is not the case you can use the 45 parameters BSc in that there are a lot of parameters we can if you want to increase your block size 220 MB 25 MB
find you can go out and do it and you can create millions of address assets dreams everything is possible and since it is in a mining was there is no difficult it is very fast so that A signature processing unlimited notes ok block time Bazar slowest 2 seconds to these are the benefits of it
OK so the next is parents not DAT file so we will look at this in when we look at in the practical files what happens is moment you spin a pen at work what happens if you get this that file initiated so here is why all this parameters can be changed so so first you know what all things can be done so you create a blockchain
so probly what do you do is so this all instead of seeing it as a Theory will look at practical aspect of it before that will take a break ok once you are done with the break what I wanted to do was actually we need to machines to interact with this multichain ok so I don't know I might not have done this it's pretty fast you can do it so
I want you to do is execute this first till stay up till step 10 ok till step 10 what we're trying to do was she already you have a VM in your you have a machine
have a machine Naidu yureka machine we are trying to clone that machine and then we are trying to create a another machine so that they both can communicate ok so can you all follow you know right after the break follow this take this practical file of it and followed till step 10 is that ok so rest of it is all practical
hey can I get a Quick yes or no let me know kahan lovika Rakesh Shailendra ok ok fine so probly will take another
find city area that's why he thank you thank you so so guys are the first person is important till stepped in ok so what I would do it will take a 10 minute break and if you want to enable as soon as see your pic is then try to
set up this environment ok
Supreme Pipe all of your setting it up let me know if you have any difficulty
Sri Lanka do you have need anything I'm help let me know Farhan Subhash
team have you all completed can I get quick yes or no
Shailendra can you share your screen let me see what's going on
plus you get this only Minions 110 we also facing the same problem
ok no cancel it not found just cancel it go to the terminal window and type of conflict
no I have configure
iif config you can you scroll up can you scrollable maximize your terminal window
ok vidmate IC 150 6.10 to open your other other machine open your another VM clone VM open another machine cloned machine open your virtualbox and open another VM that you
yeah click on that who you are not cloned another machine so how good it is very all able to clone the machine
hey I don't know whether my question Windows not working can I get a Quick yes or no from others Srilanka Farhan and get a Quick yes or no
teen mum sleeping and meet you give me a minute ok
so I thought he would have done this step he can clone that machine to get another VM but
hello Shri are you there hello
ok so Shailendra let's do something ok chalega can you go ahead what we should do was or what are you doing I will show in my machine then probly can try it in a late later in your machines that will be better
so what is the Royals meaning that fine ok so let me share my machine give me a minute
so if you see here Chennai the tried to follow me ok so once you are done with the class please do not try to your first the initial part of it then you should be fine if first 1 others so have two machines here
so that's why you can see that so that is my ID yureka VM and there is a clone too so if you want to take a clone in as simple as machine and then do do a clone UK US top it and then if you do not suppose if I want to take this machine at home machine and you know if I do a clone it will be cloned ok so I get 2 copies of that machine OK then I really what I should do if I should type this I have configure
ok let me show you this is my machine clone to ok this is called my head yureka Chrome to so here I type in ifconfig here I get 100.5 so what I get here that's another machine login here so if config here so here I get 100.3 right so from this machine
m i should be able to ping the other machine 168 dot 100.5 ok I am able to do similarly from other machine also would be able to do it okay 100.5 so what I will do is being 192 168 dot 100.3 this also working ok so now both machines are ready once this is ready only then I can
good and do all this rest of it all the multi saying commands and stuff like that so this is the basic step so others are we all good tell here can I get a Quick yes or no
Shailendra what you'll have to do is in your virtualbox you stop the VM the current VMware using right you still have to stop it then click on this machine option you will have a option called clone ok so by that we can clone a machine
so you look at here so I think they are not given the details of how to clone but that is so we'll have to come ok these are the important steps so what we do if we install multi Chain and then we are trying to clone it ok this is the step you need to KN you will be given in Eureka VM for practical you can clone that machine to get another VM of the same car
configuration ok ok now I'll show it in my machine fine or you can use your own machine for now okay we can't do much so it will take another 1520 minutes let's finish of the practical and then you can try it at your home you have any difficulty let's do it in the next class is that ok Sarah
find it first step is what what we are doing is there trying to ssh so basically now we tried to ping right so here we should make sure that we are able to ping the other machine and also ssh basic we should be able to connect the other machine IFB 100.5 right
know what I would do if I could do ssh into that missing yes and last for a password or soda said Eureka now you see me in FB login to the other machine hundred Note 3 so now if I type if I have come so it will be 100.3 ok so fine now we are made sure that ssh works OK what is the next
mixture staples we are creating a blockchain as simple as you know multichain YouTube create chain you we have seen read it is very easy to spin a pehchane in multi Chain and 1 days as simple as running this change the moment I run this time so I get a problem that you know it is already there so I am going to do this I am delete this file and let me daily test copy and delete this
ok its done now so similarly what I will do wish I will delete the other machine as well ok so this is also not so what I'm going to do I will create something could change one ok so now I get previously gotten
now I get a successfully generated message ok so now let's go into this file and see what it is that me open Visual Studio code
ok Sona let me open it so what is the part that homemade Eureka multichain ride home
homemade yureka s****** son home said Eureka that sometimes what happens is this 8.5 light so it is a hidden file so we on me know
you no problem ok for some reason it is not able to open the hidden field ok so wait a minute control Hitch
ambarsar Eureka edureka so now we see multichain so inside this multichain there is a chain ok so here we are going to go and look at this parents that folder now let's see if it is available open folder ok for some reason it is hidden
ok so its fine now let's let me I'll Open this file and show you what with code so this is the file ok so we were talking about all those parameters right so it has rich parameter multichain to dissolve all the parameters are here okay Subir maintenance in some parameters for now left understand that this those parameters ok any questions feel here
ok fine so now we have created the chain so we are we have looked that too what are the settings so that we have located in Visual Studio code OK then now what we're going to do it will start this process as a demon ok so Demons multichain D is the command and what is the change we have created same one so that one will start as a demon ok so for that
Commandos looks copy this see most of it is like very easy for YouTube even though you miss the classes something it's the same ok we are going to do the same thing should not be a problem multichain so this one okay here we are it is very awkward scene 1 then yes
100.5 give me a minute so this is our change default settings
sweet you're getting some error just give me a minute to others are also facing the same error
so there is some parameters issue that we have deleted it right so let us delete this again so no such file ok so let's create it again then multichain
so we have created it then next what we are doing ok other notes can connect to this network using hundred dot 3 wait a minute so what is this machine configuration
yeah probably will set us some sentences simple confusion what will do is prompt and we'll set this as machine one there is no prompt so ke this is 100.3 ID Eureka VM is a hundred Note 3 machine and then
100.5 machine ok first will clear both the parents that file this one I'm going to clear okay cleared here also latest clear my ID Eureka VM and clone VM also I am going to clear so both are cleared ok so then now nothing no configuration it so in hundred Note 3 machine that is my idea what I'm going to do is
first create this file called chain one probably will use a different name will say that chain or No 1 your chain 99 something like that so fine so now we have create or directly created in Dream On sorry yes
no demon first it's going to be first we need this para first we need to create this chain I have let's change one only so now this is done
Suno next to staples multichain Vande month is what we are going to run the next step ok in the same machine this one we have looked that the parents that file ok and same thing we are going to start the demon this machine ok again says incorrect email id guys
happy saturday Thali rectory first none of that is a problem with the data directory because of a hidden file created that and
nicardia I create something called dated here ok so now what are you doing we first create this multichain 1 or 19 and whatever it is
yeah that's what I am trying to do such a 99 and what we do if I will mention the data data data there's a command so here I am going to maintenance was not invalid rule
teaching you till life and iPhone help ok so just give me a second so we are going to create c99 and data there is equal to ok if an iPhone data to a sequel and too so we'll give this path what is the spa
