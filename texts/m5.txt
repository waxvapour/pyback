hello really able to hear me
tin can I get a Quick cash or no are you able to see my screen and about my voice
ok ok I got an yes from Shailendra how about others no screen it ok
BBC mystery now ok good find another some issues you know I tried long in around 7:55 but for some reason I didn't allow me ok let's go out and get started so a quick recap of what we did in the last four classes it was all about Bitcoin what is this Bitcoin what is a concept shall we were trying to understand
what is the centralised system decentralized system how are distributed system works what all components required for a distributed system to another to exist so we look that those parameters and weaves sometime deep dive into a Bitcoin mining and find out like know how to mine what is this manager job or what are the doing we look that that and then we moved on to transaction level like you know how this utxo works
our transaction get smooth from one person to another we went up to opcode level and find out like how that is getting verified and wheel of data mining concepts like you know what are the different types of pool mining and in a solo mining we look that that and also be patch based upon eatery and other Flats available like what all other platforms are what is the smart contact all about
so now in this class we're going to look at it early I'm ok so good today's class mostly will be half of the class will be practicals alike in awhile be teaching right now what is this language about solid AP code but even when I say practicals I am going to show you ok so you are going to take this knowledge and what we're discussing today in the class and then you're going to try the programs
outside Ganesh outside at the end of the cash and tomorrow session will be setting up in a will be closely working with the private chain that is you know tomorrow is when we are going to use a virtual machine so before coming to tomorrow's class you know if anyone is not able to install please do get in touch with the support team today and get it fixed ok so tomorrow when we after working on practicals it'll be good if everyone has the machine
ok mission ready so any questions before we move on we start with aquarium always anywhere rustic up with something are we good to move on
ok fine good so now you can write so how this is Aryan is all started this theory I'm actually is founded by vitalik buterin ok so he was a Canadian born Russian I believe so what is happening is what happened this he was a bitcoin core development team ok see you work for Bitcoin so any any protocol changes
Bitcoin or anything with the community has to adopt so he was part of it out like why can't we use this instead of using it for money just for financial aspect of it why can't be used for something else you know something bigger ok so that's when he started you know he could actually founded this company called ethereum ok and then they can I brought on this concept call smart contracts that is so it all started in the Bitcoin
in Bitcoin world we have mentioned that it is not a Turing complete language that is it cannot have more conditions and there is no for loops and stuff like that because why it was awarded because if there is a for loop some of the transactions rides transactions or something if it goes on in a loop ok so they don't want to come just to the network ok for 10 or 20 people are sending this follows indefinite lose their own not consistent work ok and it was it was bitcoind West
early man for a financial aspect ok so so that is why it was not Turing complete where is when it comes to eat here talking about smart contracts ok so it needs to be during complete of course right so if you look at any contract the Rubies conditions for loops and stuff like that so that's why they want to build some Turing complete language and so easily and has all those concepts concepts that you're completely ok now you can ask me like the same
no problem and same things would happen here in a Hawa Hawa they avoiding you so we look at that you know later so what all what all was the name of a promoter they what are the way they were trying one was like Bitcoin they also created their own currency named ETA ok and they want to build something called decentralized autonomous organisation something like
you'll have to have a organisation with no see your house your face nothing ok but they all work collaboratively based on smart contracts so they want to create a concept of a and S Duos in place ok and smart contract smart property these all where the things they try to achieve so let's do a quick comparison between them Bitcoin and ethereum so concept is only for Digital money
Bitcoin financial aspect and ethereum it was meant to be like a world computer like anybody can interact write some contracts reply was contraction the Atrium virtual machine and anybody can participate with this interacting with the code or interact with this contract with kind what we can also anybody is open to join but only for another can either do Mining or they can buy Bitcoin or transfer to someone only financial year
right so here it was meant for a totally different purpose and founder of Bitcoin me know that it is innocent oceanic Hotel but you know its identity is unknown till now and this one is vitally kinda steam a main language we have seen incomplete and complete and release date 2009 it was released ethorium 2015 coin released by that like how it was released
mining this one through this one. Relief methods nothing at Bitcoin when it came to existence what happened was Santoshi nakamura mind something and then he released to the community then go people started using so this was like a plan launch that is like in Bikaner was release no one knew that he knows everything is going to happen but it is not and it was not the case with him it was all published the white paper was published and you know
it was like it there something called initial coin offering so they say that in a you participate you invest some money on us and we will give you talk and speak ok so that's over ethorium started and so we know that average block times over for one block to get mind it will take 10 minutes in Bitcoin world where is in ethereum it'll take one just 12 to 15 seconds very fast so
questions to know ok fine super simply put while Bitcoin can be described as digital money financial and eatery Ms for decentralized platform for smart contract which is highly Programmable digital money so you can come
it is it goes hand in hand hand in hand actually you can have money aspect and you can have smart contract SPD can both of them together so that is a beauty of ethereum now what is smart contracts right so will look at what is a smart contract so I can you please touch base on iOS
nothing but initial coin offering so that is if someone supposed Shailendra you want to start a project ok so what you you have like a groundbreaking ID and you want to do something in normal way if you go approach Angel investors or someone who can invest you on a new start up and you Raise funds and then you start working on it right so this is ICU a new way of
Hero raising funds what people say is that they say that even this is my company and this is this going to do so and so you release a white paper and what you do with you create a token suppose you are opening some some recruitment company you can create somewhere recruitment ok some etoken something like that you can create and you tell them like you know what is your white paper all about it in the white to break and explain about your company and what are your plans who is your
game and all the stuff and then based on that you in the open market place you say that this is my ICU and if you are interested in a deposit some funds in interview would be giving them tokens so that is all I see all about it so smart contracts what is the smart contracts ok we are looking and you heard this number now
it's on smart contracts me many people do you know power in blockchain you can set a smart contracts so smart contracts is nothing but a piece of code ok you tell what happens to you take a credit card for example ok from a banking institution what happens to sign papers right you're saying what all need to do or nowadays in the digital world what you do is there is a list of FIR details like what you need to do use in a select some checkmark you accept the risk whatever it is
ok you are you sign in one or the other way so once upon signature what happens is so that is nothing but a contract you are signing a contract if there is a one year maintenance will have to pay all those people don't read it but actually ucc that is a contract so these contracts are built and people in a sign on top of it and that is however you get a card ok now all this contract who is on in this corner
this contract is owned by saved is a Bank of America Bank of America wants that counter write this contract we have a copy though we sign it and give it so why the idea here is why can't we have the contract in the form of code ok and which is in it could be public if some contacts if you want to see it is public open to all ok you can see like in a when the contract is going to expire what is the common
tractor modified now the stuff ok so this all things we can write in the form of code and deploy to the blockchain so that is smart contracts latest take another example so if you were going to leave an apartment ok so from same Jain 2018 till December 2018 ok so this is a contract ok and the property on a ledge say that he is maintaining a number of horses he has like 100 + 4000 + houses
ok so now we have a maintain a database and stuff like that right why can't you develop the same contract ok and contract smart contract and deployed in blockchain ok so what is the benefit we get out of it ok so we can dinner today also things works right so you go rent your home to stay for one year and Newark it back not a problem at all so why do you want to make the smart contract the smart contract goes to the next level do you build a contract so what you can
do if you can send funds to the contract ok and suppose you wake it in the contract they mentioned that in a few if you break the lease or if you break the lease by one month ok you get only 10% of the amount in now what what happens someone some landlord has to calculate like you know only 10% of the amount has to be on hold and remaining amount has to be returned to you all this things can be returned the smart contract you can send money to smart contract
that you do you know that will be there moment you see that and all smart contract she is that you know you have been tested the the accepted amount of time so contract in cell will hold it so there is no manual intervention landlord doesn't have play at all doesn't make sense so that is where we are moving to still there are some setbacks some external data we need some external data still there are challenges but this is the notion of 8 odd even this is so
they think the smart contract would evolve in overtime to get it the question any questions and I don't see any questions today morning
free Sandeep all good Rupesh is so how is how its different than the normal world's contractor that's what if you take the same leasing example ride so someone there is someone who looks at your maintains a contract ok in a physical form so if you normally what happens if you go to hell leasing of if you rent an apartment ok you'll have to see in the
send all documents right and someone the property manager there maintains that and lets the same example whatever I have given to 1 hours 1 month if you don't stay OK then what will happen if you go meet the apartment manager say that you know you are vacating before 12 month ok and he calculate the expenses and gives you a check back or something like that right but think like
12 month period please ok you don't have to do any 11th month your going to vacate ok all that you'll have to do if you click Kore navigate button or something in the online what it does is automatically the smart contract calculates like you know what is the amount you have to pay and even the payment will be initiated to you ok and you wake up the place it's that we see are you getting it Rupesh
ok question from Mohit how different is smart contracts from a workflow driven application workflow driven application application save workflow driven is certain process happens then the works to close ads and to complete it in a third one so that is that is what you mean I think you mean by workflow application so if you look at workflow application still
payment ok there are things you can automate in today's world ok but still there is in this workflow application will be centrally someone would be owning it okay centrally they'll have control over that ok or and definitely there won't be any financial aspect of it that is suppose at the end of of obligation in a workflow 5 if the payment has to be released
it will not be that easy and payment has to be released will be there mentioned in some contract awesome a document ok but that is not there for you to see got a bit question from JSON where all the smart contracts have been implemented so far this is it is more of a starting stage ok smart contracts are implemented for all this I see
there is once you deposit money automatically contract since you back the token circuits implemented for that and some use case for example I was working with one Health Care Healthcare doesn't actually so what they were trying to do with the smart contracts is so they wear a moment a person ok today's world if you look at in the US what happens is health data
no I don't know how many of you are from Healthcare ok so that is this hipaa things and all right so even if you go to hospital what happens if you get another know that someone gets a signature that you are allowed to share your data with someone or your wife can see your data something like that would be their spouse so all these are smart contract that no its not production ready ok but what they are trying to implement is
moment you think like you want to share file with your medical records with someone ok so that is in a Enclave AWD it stored in somewhere and smart contract you can rules are setup that if you are medical records has to be viewed even by auditory person or a doctor ok they need your approval how the approval happens today you got you can you go physically to the doctors place and you see that and you can sign it
now how it is going to change you are going to have a mobile app and you make a transaction that I need to share my medical records with this person ok and it begins a transaction and get close to the particular person ok Vamsi dance does a complete with this process then he again it goes to that enclave this one example so there are many places there trying to implement the smart contracts another example would be land registration ok
the world to land registration dissolve in the in kubernetes stage ok this is not mature and it's not all production ready suppose you purchase a land ok so what will happen is that each piece of land will be there in the Marketplace to be made sure if you want to transfer a piece of land that also can be done via smart contracts suggestion did you get it so that is questions from Dennis once you send out the smart contract can you change it movie
change it that's very good question we can't change it because the contracts right so if it's not change if if you look at it so if you buy your credit card so contractors contract is there is a problem with the contract what they can do is they can destroy the contract and create a new contract so there is a question from Sudhir where is the smart contract so is it also mind as a financial transaction that's right contract to stored on the underlying even
which we are going to see now ok and it is also mind for blockchain World whether it be a smart contract or anything if there is a transaction ok it will mine as its employees that so as per my understanding what are the steps underflow could be smart Contract Act
so is it the only smart contract in the market know their other platforms coming up there something called me O ok it's a competitor of competitor of what is it in theory I'm ok there is so you can write in hyperledger if you want to Sweet dream is mostly for the suited for public world ok and if you want to go for a private in a private network then
you can go for fabric question from foreign how physical verification can be integrated into smart contract ok so that's a good question ok so now we are moving completely into a digital world right so physical verification probably in future OK what is ok hope you all know about this iot right iot devices so probly what
could be happen is physical if someone is verifying probly that could be and video or something like that you sign it and send it so that could be on a fun of elements let me tell you another example how this in our computers are going to interact with the smart contract ok today if you order something from Amazon OK what happens if you Amazon gives you a tracking id where you find out like where is your shipment
you continuously contract ok but who is entering the shifting ID shipping ID suppose you are ordering something and you know your shipment providers FedEx FedEx will give you a link you consistently ad and find out like where your packages so it is nothing but FedEx is manually typing in that you know I am at this location so this is for FedEx suppose a big shipment is ok arriving from China to US and let's say that it
some frozen products or something that ok and so the idea is this frozen product right has to be maintained in the certain temperature ok all the way through it reaches us so suppose if the temperature is min temperature is not contract ok so what will have what should happen is it may get spoil ok in today's world it's very difficult to monitor this and find out whether
lettuce reduced in temperature something that but with the age we are in ok so there is there are some iot devices ok so where you can fit into the container what is iot devices would do is continuously every sale its every 1 minute it will find out what my temperature of the containers and it will continuously write in blockchain so since it is writing immediately in blockchain with cannot temper ok and the machine itself is writing there is no way it could I know it would force
ok so why this way they can their trying to find out whether my shipment which has to be in the contract is attached to arrive in this temperature in so so so that is all we interact with is another real time example for ok so we are in a very very early stage we are inside we are going to look at what is smart contracts how to write basics of it ok still there is a plenty of things to learn how to integrate with
platforms how to integrate with Oracle platform how to integrate with SAP how to how to collaborate with iot so there are a lot of things which are going on flavours able to answer your questions so next how
information blockchain ok so we are talking about this is again there is an example so suppose you want to create a blockchain within your office ok let's say that as simple as that you have done something great and you are rewarded the token ok so those tokens you know you can return it sometime you know you'll have to physically carry all the stuff right you'll have to cut ok no problem they say
got an email or something ok so now what will happen is you can go to the enough for that database and everything will be there now what can happen is they can create this tokens in a in a private environment suppose you work for IBM CEO IBM create your token you can then you can collaboratively use the token for what purpose you want to use ok so you with an organisation you can say
smart contracts another example would be so your organisation say that it's it is a in AP your organisation wants to track in a people's travel and some people button to travel right from on locations of this these all can be tracked using boxing so whatever it is you if you find out alright use case so that this light water
tries to explain is conceptually if you want to create a blockchain for your own environment it is possible make sense so this all like you know they make some contracts between private parties this can be done and these things right this physical contact is nothing but in all its all smart contracts this physical contracts now or getting change the smart contracts
show me which is open to all people can see like what is return the smart contract and then accordingly it works and one common question which I hear from people is in actually very good question ok so I'm ok with the common question is ok you say about smart contracts we are writing this contracts in the form of code ok how will the common man and best
what is the smart contracts ok so till now it is only in a code format suppose if you want to understand when someone third party who is trying to work with this month and I are going to transfer only wait till now is to read the code and understand it ok or there are some tools which would tell you like what the contract is available I level ok but this is you can compare it with the Linux machines Linux is known that it is open so
ok so it's the community right most of the community or people were very stood there look at the code find out yes this is good and they are tested ok so home and we all we all know that he knows all the organisations are now working with Linux closely it's the same way the smart contracts is also in the same there is a question from will ask and smart contracts BU
casino industry are there in use cases you are aware of not that I know of Vilas but definitely they would be trying ok sometime in my batch ok one guy was from casino industry on person was and he was trying to learn smart contracts but I haven't discussed about the use case there is a question from Sudheer is permission blockchain within theorem it is possible so that is what we will see tomorrow
permission blockchain can interact with external part is like vendors you'll have to permission that particular vendor Jason so you can pick and choose like who is going to participate in a boxing so question from there is am imagine that is an existing blockchain in US after few years of usage gift
organisation decides to have a smart contract then can it be done that that is possible one has to bring down the smart contract and bring a new one it is completely possible so if you look at it so it area again like you in a bit in the Bitcoin world Bitcoin is the currency
ethereum world currency is known as either so it is the currency I hope all of you might be anybody don't know about currency called either anyone in the team so the value so either either like a bitcoin trade so this was another cryptocurrency which where which was created by this vital
canteen ok and they had similar concept in fact they use same Bitcoin Concept the proof of work all those things are same only thing that we the little bit on the proof of work algorithm little bit and they created if you look at Bitcoin the block time interval is around 10 minutes but here they made it to 12 to 15 seconds
Shraddha Das and other questions from Shailendra do we have any database to be stored for all the contract or will be on peer to peer network see the all the contractor its whatever the contacts it's all in ETV all in the blocks whatever it is right so it'll all be in the blocks okay there is a DB call level DB in Bitcoin classy look that utxo UEFA utxo
all the to maintain all the UT access it was true level TV so similarly here answer of utxo we have something called account-based here it is call account based model so we look at that so that lol get stored in something called level DP and see if you want to send Ether to a person like how you pay Bitcoin transactions
similarly you need to pay if the transaction fee and the transaction fee which are going to pay for the menu network so it is called gas ok this ok so we'll see what is gas and so before that you're not denomination table of ether so it is like 1 and 18 zero sampling 12
456001 and 18 zeros it is like it is like your pizza at pizza or sense okay from sense Here they called as we baggage lovely Shannon and either ok 1 ^ 8 hours 18 that's how this order nominated ok
so there is a question from Anand what is bitcoin equivalent of gas Bitcoin the infected this it if you look at you want to say transfer $100 ok whatever you are sending right its probly your sending 10 cents ok its call sense right so there in the Bitcoin world is call Santosh is the smallest unit
call Santoshi show the smallest unit whatever you try to send this call Santoshi here in the world their own called you send hear the smallest unit is we write you are going to send we are here they don't call it we they use the concept call gas will look at it ok what is so that's our next topic in this poem for gas ok so why why we know what is gas so gas is
min transaction fee which were going to pay to the network in your 2 for sending any transactions ok so what is this gas I will see that so guess right so what is this gas is nothing but
it's a transaction fee Ok why we need this transaction fee sometime back I told you it's Turing complete language right so if there is a Turing complete Sandwich okay suppose you write a smart contract ok we write a smart contract and the smart contract what you do is you write some if conditions there is a for loop condition ok and there is some whatever right you read all of this what will happen is all these
conditions and for loops LOL get translated to something called in a very low level diesel gets translated to something called opcode ok ok like ANR old olden days not old and still there like Oliver 8085 processor read it all has opted for push pull so far all these opcodes there is a gas cost associated suppose if you're using if condition sale at the gas causes one
ok and if you are using for loop suffer for loop supposed selected by seeing you are looking at a smart guy says like 200 gas then you are using a struct variable inside struct you are having 10 parameters ok so for this there will be a gas allocated ok so this for this the record ok so you want to deploy smart contract then
ok fine you are allowed to deploy smart contract but doesn't it will calculate like you know what is that you are trying to deploy OK so how much source code you are trying to or you are going to push into the network based on this of course ok the amount of gas will be calculated ok so this amount of gas will be calculated and gas price will be given by the net
ok so that is so it will change depending so post the networks to congested the and then the gas price will be Hai OK so the gas price in all same time same with like Bitcoin also if you look at Bitcoin now just now the market is not doing good and the transaction fee is very very minimal likewise so the amount of gas and gas when it's the same suppose you have 100 unit amount of gas
hundred and gas prices let's say that to then you'll have to paid 200 guest equalent ok make sense so again ll repeated so you write up a smart contract ok for a transaction it is more or less the same suppose if you want to send money from one person to another person okay bobs and still need to add
ok so bees have typical same transaction fee like how you see in Bitcoin to ethereum world you are also allowed to write smart contract ok so when you write smart contracts internally this is so it is calculated so I'm using what all commands are used in my code based on this of course will be calculated ok so this of course would be summed up and then find little amount to a certain amount of cash and gas price will be given by the network based on that that much
out of gas you'll have to pay to deploy smart contracts okay latest say that you are trying to pay you are trying to create indefinite look ok let's say that I zero sum 1 million something like that you put or 10 Million and billion something like that its 1 bilion taxation sure trying to do ok basically what you are trying to do is your trying to connect the network right someone there is a bug in your code whatever it is OK it is going to do one billionaire one trillion
OK then what will happen is it will accordingly calculate the gas awesome oh let's say that another gas calculated was only like a maximum of 10000 was calculated ok so that much amount of price hope that much amount of price you are paid as a transaction fee so moment it but here for 1billion it request so much amount of gas then what will happen is it will keep on trying ok moment it
teachers your transaction limit on your price you paid for that deployment right moment it expires your contract will your contract will be contract that particular transaction would get stopped make sense this a beauty of it this is how they achieved this is how they achieved what is it the Turing completeness ok suppose if I make 1billion calculations ok so this is
smart country have a method called set payroll something like that ok some method this is my smart contract no that's all deployed fine ok so now this method is not doing more calculation calculation than the gas price which it had sent in that case what happen it is going to fail Halfway ok so that is how they they were taken care of
Turing completeness can you repeat it I will do that so basically right so you'll have to pay some kind of a transaction fee to the network to deploy something on the network to initiate a transaction in Bitcoin world it was very simple ok it wasn't that Complex you send the money to someone you love to pay it fine if you look At Smart contract value right
code and then reply get a network OK your code could do anything you can you up to you know if you know the syntax you are right to you are allowed to write your own code yes or no on stopping while doing so suppose you are trying to make more calculations are more thing but your paid only very less amount of gas then what will happen is your another network itself will take care that you know you have paid 2000
ok but the work your contract is doing is 4208 would finds out that it will find ok it will stop a property so its Latino paid stores and gas ok this is the paid amount but work done is more than thousand ok so this is a work done so if it is more than 2000 then the work would get stuck at the smart contract will not go beyond this amount of gas
make sense Rupesh what we keep saying etherium is cheap noexpand isn't gas the charge sheet that's right it's a charge fee is this language object oriented yes it is object oriented how much it is 200 gas ok so there is a price calculator
change let's look at gas price calculated price ok so ok so very out 200 very less normally will be more than 21000 gas price ok
so roughly around u c 0. It's take a bigger number ok so if I take two hundred thousands so it is equal and 2.00 to iterate NS 200 is just an arbitrary number
ok so question from Shailendra was suppose we deploy smart contract and private chain then we don't have to pay gas yeah you can tune right to privacy no one is going to mine and it doesn't have any value yeah that's right we can even said the gas price 20 private world ok if I have 1billion calculations however I don't have enough gas limit will
transaction be incomplete yes if you're being complete the reason being right why they want to do is certain things write the smart contract is designed to do only certain amount of work it cannot do like enormous calculations so if that you know it is a smart contract has a new subject Ride It is a smart contract not do complex calculations are in a billions of trees that is that is not it is meant for
ok so once the network finds out so this is network which works in the interest of all public right moment it finds out that something has gone wrong OK you know the amount of gas then it will completely reward that you know the entire thing will be reverted ok nothing would go through you might think about that on the city do not worry about that whatever you initiate 1billion right so for 1 million whatever
change everything will be reverted back another thing I answered your question want to some work Austin question from Anand to answer your question so if I get a gas price for transaction if network is not busy will the gas price returned know it will
ok soap what happens is your gas price what happen is at run time it will be calculator and that's your gas price will you will know like you know this is the gas price you'll have to pay for ok and it will not be returned the answer is no but maybe you try after day network is not conjuncts congested you might get a relatively cheaper gas price that is possible but its not going to return
ok is there proof of work needed for smart contracts yes there will be a proof of work ok will look at that ok so can you repeat Anand so the ideas suppose you want to do OK will look at atomicity of gas so suppose if you're in the database world so for one to hundred ok 121 300 you are making some changes ok take one to Hubli
something like bigger number and suppose you have changed for One For The Count of 1 you changed some X variable to some for to change again for to change Ok and it is stopping in hundred million ok so what will happen is it is going to revert the entire thing you can say whatever is getting deployed ride so it will just hold back to the old one so the entire thing will not go through make sense it is not that not till hundred million it is past and remaining it feel
don't know it's not like that completely be rolled back and should I invite you to buy that way we can what if it is transferring money from Bob to Alice with with each loop
ok whatever it is ok so jao good question what is transferring money from Bob to Alice ok so in each loop the plan is to transfer money from Bob to Alice ok so what is that is so this will not go through it is not like when you send the money you are initiated transaction OK it is not like that ok it's all couple together and then are you doing a final send is what does matters otherwise it will get stopped in between even not stopped in between
I'll be reverted back make sense it is not like you know you take a smart contract you perform sum calculation ok so after the centre for loop or your code complete then only becomes a transaction make sense it is not like you do step here that becomes a transaction no
that's right exactly he is there may be available for programmers to get gas price on runtime yes it is you know that show know that is what is used your DP is are used here to find out what is the desperate ok so moving on
that's all about gas ok just explain something deep so how old is calculate calculated there is a question from Shailendra suppose we have to for loop 1 if one while loop so total 4 transaction no no no no 3 loop is not a transaction OK your entire
anything after your whatever the smart contract right to your entire thing once it completes then only becomes a transaction ok all level it doesn't become a transaction to answer your questions I'll introduce just one yeah full contract that's right so this is our the transaction cost is estimated so what we saw like you know the amount of gas we're using and the current
price based on that it will calculate and tell you like and what is the amount of gas you need to pay to the network this is system meeting here there in the given this link how to find out the gas price rate current gas price or etherscan otherwise you can find it out ok
now will look at this concept and then will take a quick break OK so how you remember when we discussed about Bitcoin we discussed about the concept call utxo right so doesn't spend transaction output so that is win Bob suppose let's say that god has 5 bit coins and he want to send the 3 Bitcoins to Alice what happens isn't 3 Bitcoins to Alice and the 2 Bitcoins comes back
ok so that is so it is that's how it works in Bitcoin world so whatever amount you know your unspent amount transaction amount so that is all stored in the utxo formed and it's basically get stored in the level DBM it is getting stored in all the Machines ok all the notes which supports this YouTube so here it is not like that ok here there something
state model ok are people called as account based model or state based OK so the idea is supposed bobbers having 5 metres he sending 3 years to Alice OK what will happen is an engineer this is called state DB Nokia called state TV
so what happen is this state DB will be maintained by every party in the network like how we do you decorate similarly waste ADB also will see ok it's all actually if you see it's all level DP database name is level DP but it maintains estate ok so that's why I called state okay maintains the state of each one let's say that the bob is ok
number is 08123 931 589 I love her account number 08456 942 001 anything 08 so what will happen is if you look at in the Bitcoin world same thing ok it will all refer your UT access different you TLC when you open your wallet different UT
will be summed up and then you find out the balance ok where is here it is no other way around here here it is Bob right what are the bob 2 so here bobst sending let's say that bobbers in machine this is Bob's wallet okay bobs machine some their lives and some eggs goes on Ok
so now what happens is Bob when he sends 53 ethers to Alice get then what happens if he maintained something call this teddy bear writing this baby it will maintain and after this all this mining and things like that ok only after that the balance will be maintained like to eat and whatever in it is called state variable and for example is called state variable and lets a value
ok 208123 has got to and also now 0x 456 has got 3 ok so this one is propagated to everybody this state variable right so everyone will have a copy of it ok I'll is will have this copy ok so same thing this state variable will be proper
12 section who is in the network okay suppose you have some error when we go to smart contract I will tell you the state variable so I don't want to confuse you ok so this is a good work where is the same thing now let's compare this with utxo so if it was utxo okay bobs balance right suburbs balance could be it will not be from 0812
ok it will be from alyssa send something or someone has sent to Bob ok so all those will be maintain you take so like Bob can bobs you take so like he has got 659 has transferred 0x 1231 is there are 1 Bitcoin to Bitcoin
ok someone has transferred 456 has transferred 0x 123 how many Bitcoins one bitcoin something like that ok so when you open your open your wallet what happens if all the relative utx was associated with Bob this is all some day function as your wallet balance ok so once you want to transfer something you'll have to unlock this using your private key and then you sending it right
so here you see it is only 1 balance uan and she open your account you know like you know what is the valency of got it this state variable will be updated and I will be broadcasted to everybody is the important concept or the difference between the UT exam model in the corner model 0x 1230 public address that's right and equations
questions guys will look at this and then we'll take a quick break so Farhan not very clear
ok let me repeat it ok let's look at If in case if you have not followed up U T exam model I know I would suggest just take a look at you take some model again ok so only then you would be able to appreciate this account base model in Bitcoin world okay Bob wants to send bobs account balance ok is calculated based on UT Axis how many Bitcoins does Babu warns ok so probly this
when I say this hero X5 9th is nothing but the public key ok or your account address whatever you can call so 0859 has transferred Bob his address is 061232 Bitcoins 08456 has transferred one bitcoin 20123 ok now when he opens his wallet Bitcoin wallet box what it will find out like how many associated UT xos Bob has ok 08123
and all those will be summed up on shown as is balance showing this case it will be 3 ok but here if you take the same thing here so Bob same same thing will take okay some 0x 659 and 456 hours transferred to 11 either ok so they these two things right this you to access this will not be maintained separately
okay instead like our bank accounts who are you could have send it fine but that will be summed up on Sean here 206123 what we have 3 that's ok so that will be some the pawn shop here where is in Bitcoin World it will not be summed up at the real time in you open your wallet all your UT Axis will be calculated and shown as your balance make sense why they have used to second base model there is a very good
probly in the class will see it ok because we are not just talking about transactions you're talking about contracts getting about smart contracts state variables in a lot of things ok so that's why they wanted to go to this account this morning so any question guys ok let us I don't see any questions latest a five minute break then let's catch up
ok yes ya hope all of your back
starting with B have 30 then the transaction is 83 in sending to be 10 metres ok so what should happen is B 28 ok the other way round from B is sending to a 10 either so what happening is this amount is reduced by 10 and 9:30
Jason Christian status always maintained symptoms of ether no state has lot of things ok maintains either if there is one parameter so say tomorrow your writing lot of smart contracts in smart contracts there is something called state variables ok so that also will be maintained
so the next one is a type of accounts ok so if you look at find world it is like there are no type of account whatever you create its all like your wallet address your public but in the ethereum but its not the not the same you have a account where you can send funds and apart from that you create a smart contract once you create a smart
that becomes a contractor 220 both are called both have a different account I OK what is a normal account and other one is a contract with this ok so why it is different because you are external world account can only initiated transaction ok meaning that so i c contract cannot run on H1 ok someone has has to Trigger
but someone has to talk with a contract ok so that's why there is a difference make sense ok so any any question guys in terms of external owned account and contracts
not getting any questions hope getting it so the two things right 1S account ok like a bitcoin account so this account is nothing but a public key right like what we have seen this 0x 123 similarly for each smart contract you deploy lets a smart contract HK gift
card smart contract Castle smart contract so you can create different types of my contact each one will come up with an address so this let's say 0x 865 to say this one is 087895 something like this ok each one will be there are two different accounts got them but if you
want to talk to the smart contract ok you want to talk to this 08652 you will have to come through an account no cancel 0x 123 can talk to this so if you want to send funds to this thing it can send ok so that is not possible make sense so what I mean to say is so if you open your account or if you open your wallet OK your wallet only can show the extra
call not show your not considered your smart contract as your wallet make sense ok any question guys will smart contracts be stored in wallet litecoin we will look into it to the next topic is where in this wallet Smart Card circuiting store will look into it just hold on
a smart contract can hold funds question from JSON a smart contract cannot hold funds we can hold funds so wallet address is famous public that's right cylinder so will look at one by one ok for sometime this whole done for a while ok ok let's see like how the smart counter
creator and diploid ok so so these things right I will not take much time ok let's eat it is the same process ok if you look at how the validation happens in its not deep dive into it so how what happens in Bitcoin same way happens in ethereum also ok there is a slight change we have some flights and I will tell you when it will be come
ok but higher level the same kind of transaction only thing you'll have to notice this doesn't take 10 minutes ok hardly in within 10 to 15 seconds a block would be mind ok and there is a mining reward also ok so mining reward is 5 metres ok so every block you mind you get 5 ok
so that is about it so any theoretical level what happens is a lessons for transaction same thing like what happens in Bitcoin read so the miners will wait for the transaction transaction to come in so the group all these transactions and then they stay start mining how the mining works again the difficulty factor you laugh to solve the proof of algorithm it's the same ok and so here is a very good
remind Steel blocks called uncle Uncle Chips call uncle Joe ominous so it means so sometime back in on the Bitcoin what we have seen is the longest chain can separate what is the same person as mind the same block in that case in the Bitcoin world ok so what happens is there is no reward ok so no one is rewarding you once they have the consensus rules based on the consensus rule
will be selected ok in Italian world it's slightly tweak how it works is if first person means they have this consensus rule how to select this was person first person means he gets fired ok and if second person second person also went mean that at the same time if there are two or three their called uncles ok same time so they also will be rewarded ok like in a half of it or three by fourth of its not 5 either
completing 3.5 years or something they would get in the world like this up to 3 uncles or block right let's let us take this Block 1 Block 10 block 10 is Mind by Alice minimum 4 people ABCD at the same time ok this person will reward for you get 5 metres and say the other person like 33 something like that some number ok
and I also has mind for example has also as mind when buy some calculations they will only reward 3 people ok so this one the reward will be zero so this is the consensus mechanism ethorium works ok so got it so blocked in so I want you to understand this concept so these are called
all mind at the same time ok so first one will be rewarded 5 metres so others also have solved the same person but they will all be called uncles ok so they are all uncles ok so they all called uncle so they all will be rewarded ok so why Italian things that
Desh bharvad address ok the same block is verified by multiple people ok since there multiple people are mining it so you know if we give zero to all of them they will not be interested to mine ok so and also this is only a block interval of 12 to 15 seconds so they want more people to mine so there is no confirmation the same same thing right this person has mine so what happen is he will get a same OL will get the same not but it
increasing to the strength of the network ok so that's why they leave the way as it is and Anandi says that is that right yeah it's called uncle because the first block is mind and then comes the brother's father son kills father and brother uncle so that so that's why they are called uncle so there is a question from Dennis do you mean that will be all kinds of smart contracts like
car sales Contract contract on Eid blockchain can we see the various contracts and news and use it without writing our own contracts yes probably in the future that's right probly in the future that is our it's going to be ok
Sudarshan other question can one account have multiple wallets can one account have multiple wallets can I don't know what do you mean by that one account can have multiple wallets see account is nothing but you are
ok I get what your saying what you are saying is so suppose you have a Jaxx wallet same account do wall also want to have it in Exodus if you mean by that it is all public and private key ok wallet there all providing an interface if you have the for that particular public if you have can have a private key yes you are you can have not a problem and good question from Sudheer is there a cab for no
foetus there is no cap ok like 21 million therium does not have a cap or case we can create a number of heaters about it and so mining reward so he is its 5 metres okay currently the block her what is for either
yeah like blockchain that info ok so for either there is something called etherscan.io scan data you ok like blockchain read this is ethereum block Explorer then find out
how many blocks where there now since we've got an idea sometime after the class just look at all of it okay Shailendra can we attach Jackson metamask In same account yeah you can do that in all it needs is a basically it is tied up to your public and private key ok so if you can match that in the wallet okay some
new provides features that you can import private key if you do that yes you can find out you can have good at both locations so then is very clear then is Jason Shailendra
ok so now we look at the consensus mechanism ok same me know I will not take much time here it is this am ok with the little quick as I mentioned ok 12 week was interview using shot 256 there using something called Shastri in a which relates
almost sha 512 ok so this is one thing and another thing this this is called it has ok the proof of work modified proof of work they call it still it is called proof of work only I know some time does it has and here there is a very good concept actually what they are doing is if you look at their that out about electricity also if The Raymond they developed it area
electricity they wanted that all of all of us to participate in the mining process ok so what day did is instead of in a few look at Bitcoin it is more and more of processing power right you need to have more number of mining rigs and then you'll have to participate with me and said no to that ok let's not accept mining Rig ok so they have something like you know your be your laptop or something its called
beta something called GPU and CPU there something called GPU so they wanted to promote more GPU - okay rather than Eric - ok showing their hash algorithm they can find out like whether your inner working with a mining Rig or something like that so a mining Rig will not work for ethereum World ok it will try to identify that a no it's coming from a mining Rig and you know it's going to discard or it's not going to work
only way here is the GPU so that's why it is mentioned here so the idea as they wanted more number of people to participate in this not the wealthy or the one who has more processing power so they wanted since the block time is 12 to 15 seconds if you have a decent enough GPU you can may still again when we say GPS again the GPU has its own like a no its not that our normal laptop
we can buy ok we need a GPS but still it is it will be kind of an affordable cost not like the mining Rig ok so any questions okay so mining at a glance same stuff like what we have done right in the Bitcoin world source
transaction gets initiated these transactions are all in a combined in a day from the transaction pool and formed as a block and compared to validate the same proof of work person can nothing different only thing is earrings are not allowed then create it and they get award and top of it here what happens is if two or three people can uncles are also the only thing
so now we will look at it Aryan Virtual Machine IBM CEO salary they do we need to write a smart contact no its not required it's as simple as you know you send funds ok it's not the only for other functionality we need to write a smart contract ok now you
look at Atrium virtual machine in detail so how many of you are from Java background or no Java JVM question answer high-level ideas
ok fine a little bit ok so normally what happens is ok in Java world ok let me javac or maybe cplusplus most of you would know C plus plus write a C language so what happens is there are like ok so
what's up before that you know Anand has a question I will so how do you differentiate between dad and uncle so the good question so it is up to the consensus ok so remember in Bitcoin world who came first there's a lot of conditions like what if two blocks are same came at the same time at that time who has solved more transactions and they look at that time stamp and beyond that it's not that change would go
I know it will create a separate chain ok and the longest and similarly the same kind of consensus rules are mentioned there so that's why they find out the dad and uncle differentiate here also there is a longest chain concept yes only thing is here there regarding the uncle ok in the Bitcoin world uncles or not record there is no concept call angles
so let me explain give you a person to javac so what will happen is so you write a Java code so after that the next step is compilation face you do compile ok after compilation what happens is it will give you bytecode ok then after you get the bytecode there is JVM
ok so JVM interpret JVM knows that this bytecode how to act upon this bytecode ok JVM take care of exuding those instructions suppose your Britain hello world program in Java ok hello world so what will happen is this will get compiled into byte code when JVM JRE JVM is installed in the information so what will happen is this will end
so it's a class yeah so from Anand when you compile what will happen is you get something you a class file so it is nothing but the bytecode class 12 this is nothing but the bytecode right
MC is JavaScript also used here will go to JavaScript later. If they will tell you what is JavaScript why you where we use JavaScript so do you need to install IBM that's right we need to install IBM right yes tennis
ok good so ke Soi terium even so AVM is a basic thing you need to deploy smart contracts OK it is compiled into bytecode MS can read and execute ok so that's the basic thing here so it is all the running in the inner behind the evening so AVM right now if you look at it even for Android they are trying to even up to her
free device there trying to deploy this even have seen on for mobile devices there yeah that's right position so we need a VM and level DB to implement E3 embroider by what happen is by default when you install IBM raid level DB also comes along
okay level DBS not like a Oracle DB or something like that it's not a heavyweight DB it's a very lightweight simple key value store database okay Lite waiting on any question guys so these are the other releases which are annoying pipeline for ethereum there something called Metropolis serinity they are trying to work on
something called the concept call sharing a lightning network there trying to get rid of proof of work protocol to proof of stake protocol RFC in one class to another trying to so lot of things are happening with ethereum
stop this train to integrate with the platform Microsoft is trying to see like how to block change can interact with each other ok she is totally into different mode he don't want to create the platform again that will be is a gay biggest success is what people think ok even though we know blockchain when you go to a customer they already have a Oracle they already have a SAP how do we integrate platforms so that comes cooker framework
ok so development Technologies will see that development Technologies sococo Framework not totally out of context ok so what is cocoa Framework someone if you have not followed ok so everyone is trying to create a blockchain
IBM is working on hyperledger fabric okay heavily to create a platform ok even though it's open source major contribution is IPM ok Intel is coming with a platform called as what is at platform no in hyperledger sawtooth Le okay Intel is coming about the platform ok so Microsoft taken a different route ok he is thinking like how to create or how to integrate different blockchain
you know that do you write sorry letter code and its compiled it's all fine ok in the IBM how do you interact with a VM ok so that is another question so you have the Saviour may have a smart contract here but here in the UAE is suppose you're using your mobile app are you using your webapp whatever it is website if you want to interact with a BBM right so right now previously the other was only JavaScript libraries which help interacting Devi
in fact this node JS libraries OK it is node JS SDK it is called with three JS ok so using this web three you can interact with even so whether it be mobile app or website you can interact with this right now they also have libraries for Python Java Python Java and something else I don't remember so Python and Java is ok you can use
please libraries also to interact with even so so that is where this JavaScript comes into picture makes sense okay so supporting Technologies these are internet hardware clients leave it let's leave this so we'll see on my own
so lost can you repeat so suppose you have everything in smart contracts like currently what is happening is your smart contracts are deployed it is all stored in IBM ok but you want to interact with it is not like you go to command line an interactive so that is not that doesn't add any value you are using a mobile phone from your mobile phone you should be if we able to
interact with IBM how do we do that that is true in a node JS libraries ok this its called node JS SDK is nothing but they give you software development kit review libraries to interact with ok so previously at start it was all node JS libraries right now you all also have Python and Java libraries to interact with so if you have in your if you have if you want to write a Java Program ok
hey using your Java program you can directly interact with even so that's weird about it make sense any questions make sense
yeah that's right so it can be contacted through compiled and interpreted code that's right yaaa node JS and web in this node JS libraries called with 3 days ok so no this library is called with 3 days
ok make a ok let's move on now we looked at each one we looked at in detail Ok so Here they were given me know pictographic how things works ok so first step out there are taking use your contract is taken it is compile so sorry didi code is compiled ok so bees
aftek employee compilation it will you get the bytecode ok so this is using compiler also there is a different version of compiler with compiler and normal compiler so shall see and there is a web 3 ok so what happens is finally it will compile and you will get a bite food ok so that is what is your return the solitary bike this step 1838 some bytecode ok
what happen is this bytecode will be stored in the ethereum virtual machine ok and all this request right so whether whatever your interacting with it is all through with 3 let's not get into it ok now tomorrow when we are going to write a smart contract you are going to write compile it so then we will know like what all components ok ok let's not get into it now it will be more of a Theory latest understand while doing practicals
ok so next one is messaging and file sharing ok so when we look at smart contract smart contract can do only certain things ok when I say you cannot upload a file into a smart contract so that is not possible ok so for that what italians aces user protocol and use different sources one is called Whisper another one is calls from UK meaning see this
here to this is form and Whisper ok so suppose in your smart contract you have a requirement of you need to store file so in that case you something calls form ok and this with the help of Swami you could Store file ok so I have any and if you come across this IP office or distributed storage any idea
ok Shailendra is this no location and probably let me tell you what it is ok so blockchain is like like his Divas but not completely his day was okay blockchain like it is in telling between systems right so I will show you something now right now this IP office is a game changing on ok if you look at
for example
Raymond I want to show you something some English content Let me find out is Turkish
ok so right now I see only Turkish but there is English so I don't want to waste time on it so the ideas if you look at the URL read you look at the URL you see EPF s.no followed by some hash
something then you see this another fired at his table ok that trying to move there in your entire Wikipedia whatever you see today to IP office ok so this interplanetary file system ok so I'll just give a quick and addition and this is whole another topic ok so with blockchain and all blockchain cannot work without IPA files without there are lot of things which are required to get a complete blockchain solution
IPU 1st level like why this IP office is required ok so you have a blockchain you have a machine it's all connected ABCD machines are connected ok and you have a requirement of you need to store file ok so but you are smart contracts min we have seen that how much gas cost is allowed more and more storage you require more no gas but still you can't store movie or something like that so in that case
ok how this IP of yourself this IP office uses a distributed storage like new like how you can call it as big data and alright so what they do is suppose you store a movie ok so this movie will be stored in parts in different machines ok different publix machine ok so ABCD ok so part of it its a 250 MB or 250
mbh to other counts on right so this will all be separated and stored ok and when you store in IP office for this file suppose you are storing a movie called movie.to movie movie one ok so once store in IPA files it will return your hash so some Jungle Random numbers ok so in your smart contract you can store this number ok anyway
when you access when you actually want Axis here so it will go find out what is in the IP office and then it will display ok so you are maintaining a smart contracts is very minimal ok and you are utilising this distributed storage as a mechanism to store big big amount of files so that so if you look at this IP office here this document ok this a very big dog mind is always into this one small thing make sense
summer in high level what I want you to get it when it comes to storage OK when it comes to a large storage in a smart contract cannot hold long store in Big storage in this cases you'll have to use this storage mechanism called IPA files on August 1 so sweet Aryan 21 and you can you something cold storage ok that is one more thing called ok for now let's see this day
semester mechanism any questions it's a very fascinating rest just find out all over IP Wikipedia right it's getting more to IP office
what about sperm and storage this other mechanism ok so if your face is a private company you can look at it office in there is a very good IPL first aid video ok so that's where first I came to know about it in fact in our projects and I'll be using IPF us just watch this next Revolution by John Bennett ok sometime when you are free just ate video it will he will give him
like what is IP office so to answer jason's mom and storage is another mechanism ok like same distributed storage like how it a Raymond fabric right so their competitors of papers make sense question from know it is a different taxes its not a Hadoop basics of shell in right side
send question from Mansi so whenever they need they will collect it from different separate systems right that's right yeah if yes how to maintain Security analyst OK it is always and again when it comes to enterprise network you can create a private you can create a private IP office it's a whole other topic so what I want you to know I just go through it ok find out
CP office I've given Idea ok now you in a find out like what it is and you know explore more appointment Ok Please God help you definitely so another one is Whisper protocol ok so this Whisper is for messaging services so that is if you want to interact from so if theory I'm like there is one node to another node if you want to do it simple chat or something like that then you can use whisper ruselt protocol ok so by default D3
ucpes and all things like that you can know you using your note address you can communicate some if you want to send some short messages like how and typically in awesome like 10 years back was still you used the socket programming and all to create chat right so similarly they are providing in the blockchain hold how do you chat ok so with blockchains ok so that is Whisper protocol ok
make sense any questions see this one we don't use much in the real time or an enterprise scenario Whisper its good to know but its not used much but its warm so on is used heavily in fact I have some time back IIFA ten 1
ok so you try reading this ok so here or not this one sorry so integrating swamini theory I'm ok instead of using IP office you so you there are steps you can follow once you are here in once you up to blockchain then that's why
integration steps are you this link sometime you can look at it ok ok good so this file transfer so other one is Mr application ok so missed missed missed application browser what they're trying to do is like how we have this Google Chrome browser right so Google Chrome browser what you can do today you can download lot of apps you can download apps and you can interact with similarly they have
come up with the browser called miss ok using this missed missed will have a direct connection with a VM ok so if you want to interact something like you can you lol have you know in the future ok it's like we don't know whether it will happen but the ideas you will also distributed apps suppose we were discussing about this car smart contract alright so each one will be an app for smart contract EP 1 have another option and said something like that so this is powered through missed
best browser is also there today ok using this missed browser you can do it make sense yeah I will I'll send the URL question guess it's you sometimes you know it is very hard to digest where we are moving on in where we are moving
Lord of new things actually so you know as soon mentioned it is under development ok so still its not production ready so buddy can download and take a look like whats happening showcase any questions or shall we move on to the next topic
ok fine so the next 1 days in some questions main difference between western regular browser is Mr will have your regular browser your Chrome browser cannot connect to ethereum Virtual Machine right so your best processor can connect to
even tho that's the main difference yeah so rupay she's asking for a break has been sometime we have looked rathiri let's take a break now so let's take 10 minute break then let's catch up there ok just
find out like missed application you should be able to find this is the one I not required Shailendra Shailendra was asking like you do we need missed to access with no not required
so guys let's break let's catch up in 8 and 5 let's catch up at 10:15
cricket sir hope all of your back so she looks for you alright let me know
working on top of it ok so once as client is called very popular ones and what we are going to look at in the class is called get so get this sorted notation is Goa Teri I'm ok so it is developed in go language ok and its for ethereum so its called yet so another platform is called parity so this is also
second popular I would say then next one is something called IFFCO and there are many many others ok so there are several platforms so in our class what we haven't use we're going to use get ok so that is what is all about the clients what you can do this so these clients it can do all this stuff where did a transaction creating accounts ok sending transfers from Montana the contracts my
all the stuff can be done by this client ok make sense so these are the different types of clients ok who has developed it so it is called get in so there is something call parity that is all these are apps ok but but popular awnser a popular on sir
ok make sense any questions question guess fine so moving on so these are the go
She Goes the popular one OK it is developed by bacteria developers itself so that is what we are going to use in the class getting some questions so what is the question from JSON is what is the link between get and solidity ok so get get and solidity good questions
if you look at here right so the contracts what we write here it is all present here all over smart contracts are here okay inside even in any in ones and zeros ok so get you get will take care of interacting with Helium ok someone has to interview the evening so that is going to be worth it make sense so in order to this will interact low level
if you want to interact high level high level is high level is what what I have mentioned we have seen Mr right so if you want to interact or you can use your own with three JS ok so like that make sense like JavaScript
sure that she basically what we are trying to do is we are trying to do connect with IBM so that is what we're trying to do OK so how to connect with you I'm so we need platforms ok by default once you install IBM you will get get along with it ok but if you think like I know you have separate company party is a popular company ok so parity want to use their own
ok so they used parity something like if you look at Java you can write an eclipse or you can use NetBeans right so but the compiler handling everything is going to contact with JVM but only the interface and the tools which uses different so in question from Sudheer in Bitcoin we have Bitcoin core why does IBM have so many clients no Bitcoin also have so many clients with kind course
one client that a lot of coins in Bitcoin also so pretty pretty recently it was actually last year if you see parity this was not full proof and it was hard and so many tears were close to you know close to me
dollar worth of foetus was stolen small bag in parity and people utilise that this is it so now we look at platform functions ok so we look at this conceptually what is this DAV we look at an example and then will move to solve the coding decoding part of it ok so what is decentralized autonomous organisation so what they thought this is what
film tortoise information that is why do we can we create organisation which is completely this implies that is there is no see your NOC office nothing like that will create a work ok so will create a work order so this work order anybody in the world can see who are wants to contribute can bit ok and based upon their work output automatically created smart card so that it will automatic
send the eaters once you complete your work so like that they wanted to create an organisation so that is called this behave in fact they created tokens also be a token and enough people some but recently this DAV token is closed ok so they all gave eaters ok so many Thursday gave you know if you have Diego token sensor
that they give very good amount of eaters it was lucky Jackpot for people who won this Diego. Ok ok now these are the people who are contributing to this so what did ladies they all created smart contract basically they created smart contract so anybody can look at the smart contract I like what is the work to be done and suppose Unnai Bob needs to work on the smart contract in there are some terms and conditions based on that he starts working on it and deploy the solution in
blockchain network people validate ok based on the validation how he has done then he gets money back so that's all things work make sense now let me show you a smart contract real smart contract
actresses that is nothing but a token ok basic attention token please ok so if you look at here they have a smart contract written ok so you can Lick Lick on this contract source and you can find out like what is their contract all about so what is this contract they were returned ok all these functions you can find out okay make sense so likewise
this Sadi a organisation what are you doing here right so all the what they've done this they have written a smart contract and published so anybody in the world can go look at like what is that contract demand based on that people participated and they were able to contribute and get directions what to Z last Bullet sale
coin and get it which money Anand can I know which slide you mean are you pointing to
ok fine ok fine so this is how this adieo automation works ok so one example is so they are trying to remember basically see here also take in a day try to create a vote you can take any example suppose you want to work for a smart contract ok so someone is writing a contract and then
goes for a what people find out like that can be worked on this so many people what about on it all this word can be seen as in a transaction like who was voted for what based on the day take the work order and work on it ok so this is like a conceptual model of like how how people working or or or or in future house things could be ok so that is the idea of this Diego model ok so summer
buffet dinner for example this is called I like you remember will pay this Minecraft game Olden game like you know we love We plant some or what is it called some bombs right so all those bombs we plan shows like that you can play in a distributed world ok you plant hear someone makes it so this is all because a transaction ok so if you want to
replace a bomb hear someone places here ok based on that you played so this was created for fund this was created in the distributed environment ok so all those whatever you please hear becomes a transaction so that's the idea of it and now latest look at this one this is very important so if you think is Aryan what all it can solve ok so what is money up ok
will you send funds from one person to another person this is completely find me we all know that how things works ok since we have seen Bitcoin we know that how ethereum works it's almost the same so next one is insurance up ok pay more attention to it here ok so here what is happening is so there is a smart contract built ok so what what did the saying his insurance company what is faces to a farmer that
you live in Iowa ok fine in agricultural land space that's why ok this is my land this is the GPS co-ordinate everything former gives ok and what Crop Insurance is that okay moment you find that is a Droid there is no rain OK then automatically through smart contract you send a farmer Crop Insurance ok so something has gone bad send a man insurance so now what is happening is real time
your smart contract pulls data from outside world that is say like what happened to in Iowa in this particular state ok in this particular land was the red route was there a feminine it collects data based on that it makes the calculations of yes or no you know then based on me know if there is a router for my something has happened rain was no wasn't proper then accordingly smart contracts in a sense in
amount to former ok just just use case how how it could work make sense are you getting this. So here if you notice here there something called external in external authority is oracles what does it mean when you are smart contract is going to pull data from the outside world is called oracles ok and this technology is also as or
the sorry girls not met you that there is a concept there is ap is which you can use but its not really mature so that's where Coco Framework is going to kitchen ok so that's idea so question I don't see any questions so the last one is there is a conceptual model where you know it's all the work whatever
redeem their work everything will be via smart contracts make sense case any questions for all these considered smart contracts yes so this money Menon not called a smart contract so this one is call smart contract the ensure
want to know their clock in time ok so that can be put Windows not contract make sense so please so there is a question from on Anand like what is Oracle circles is nothing but if you
so far this there is the terminology which is used if you want to pull some data from the outside world its called or its ok make sense ok so let me know where's the future of that's like what all will be in the Futura like I was mentioning about store their rates
thank you note to a Chase bank or different back again Union not spend time on sending all the documents to the new Bank ok so there is a KBC changed a lot of things which are coming up your KYC is specific to bank now it can be leveraged elsewhere also so what do you mean
ok so likewise from smart contract if you want to pull some external data it is called articles Ok why she is not Universal these are all in the development stages cylinder it will come up with this all an idea ok so if you look at blockchain except for
Bitcoin ethereum Ottawa transfer we do there is no ready production ready application resolve the early stages so now blockchain will be like a complex component in it without without external data ready to be very difficult right
br1m we can't talk of very broader use cases ok so this all components required to make a good blockchain platform and many more than plot from blockchain evolution because all these components ok only then it will become complete make sense
can we use webservice to access outside world right now it is not possible from smart contract inside smart control it is not possible ok so that's why all these projects are going on in the Intel Core Core Framework I mentioned it so it is for that only ones that is out so it may be a big head out could be like you know anyway so there are many players were working on it ok so now we are going to look at Programming Lang
which solid it so how long we have only 30 minutes left so basic we'll just touch with the basic OK then we'll take on the next class so any questions feel here before we move the programming any questions where you stuck up somewhere let me know
ok so I fine now let's go to the solitary programming language ok so all of you right so sorry it is the language so someone from programming back
right so you know like where to write this language you normally you need to have a ID development environment skit where you need a ride this programming language right so normally for Java and what do you use use eclipse eclipse eclipse NetBeans ok so these are some popular platforms or if you are a Dot Net developer or you might use something called visual studio or a c plus plus developer Visual Studio
some other tools are there is something called atom people could use that there is something called the different platforms that's what I mean by now for solid DD you can use Visual Studio code ok this is one or enough for simple testing or what you can uses with compiler
scald remix of you can try if you open a new tab and try remix space solidity space browser ok and click on this remix solidity ID
ok
me any question guys are you all able to open at Anand Dinesh Farhan Jason Malegaon Sandeep Sudhir Sudhanshu Vamsi ok good
Sandeep is not able to open so Sandeep all you have to do is type remix space already the space browser ok open the first URL ok Sandeep let me know if you have opened
so how about others Rakesh maligawa you all able to open it ok good so we look at this compiler design of basic you look at this thing ok since will be using
lot on next couple of classes at least ok so you can see here you press a plus but I'm ok you can create a new file ok so your file name ends with dot SOL means a solid if you feel ok no problem create something called sample click ok so this is a sample solved it if I so this is where you write all yours
smart contracts ok One dimension this is one platform to write simple testing and all we can use this process browse web based compiler ok ok so there is one more thing which I need to add ok so once you write a piece of code ok and
you compile it ok you get 2 things you get a b and you get something called bytecode ok to things are returned right now what is happening is you get one JSON file which has both a b and bytecode
OK go to guess so there will be a couple of things once you compile what happens normal in the JAVA will when you compile you get a class file in you compile a c plus plus program what you get in cplusplus what you get this all data files you get all data files OK then you'll have to do a linking and then you create an output binary file so similarly in solidity world once you compile you get both a ba and bytecode make sense
ok so now what the first step right socketing I will just in I am going to write a simple one ok don't worry what we are doing is Contract contract sample ok is what we've got you return a simple corner
ok so so the next for some reason what is happening and give me a minute
ok fine so guys what is happening yes ok so I had some you know some of you like it was not allowing me to make impeller Roshan getting loaded due to pop up blocker so I just disable it
so this is simple contract we are meant to live in a look at all the rules ok for now what do you want you to understand is if you click this plus button you create a file and then there is a compile button you see here so what I am doing yes I click on start compile once you click on the start completely get compile OK then let's go to run ok so then you can see something like a sample like what
is there right you can see here here I will show something else also wait I am creating the smart contract now ok so once you create what happens you create in a for the sample contract you get some address or something like that OK I will repeat it so do not worry just 4 level what I want you to look at this so there is a compile-time there is runtime ok settings menu not look at it much ok so there is
One Tap so there is a debugger how you can debug the smart contact you have this ok and this all things on main thing what do you need to know this is a compiled up ok so there is a hunter these are the main things we need to know another one tab in these all parameters when we come across I'll let you know I'm getting some questions let me see
ok so now we don't have anything here right now I'm going to write a simple function let's do a get nothing is here ok so again I am going to compile it ok so what I am going to do it I am clicking on details ok so this is what I wanted to show you guys ok so once you compile your account
that will have to see this bytecode and alright so if you look at here I told you that will be getting couple of things ok 1 what will be getting on will get a b so they're on will be getting a bytecode OK so see here there is a weight on minute give me a minute so there is a place so now you look at meta data Okay showing this metadata
you can look at eBay and not here so I will copy this and I will face the complete thing here ok so one minute let me come here recently they've changed this
this is sample you a minute guess your able to follow right so what we are going through
one second yeah this is the complete baby which have got ok you can so you can see like that the other couple of things which are out of the woods with this as this complete away this is the complete bytecode so but there is
we could get the JSON file so that is what I was looking at ok but for now you have to think separate ok sir was telling you write 1 wonders like we will be having MBA bytecode and we'll have a JSON I want to show you the JSON but for now I'm fine so let's all can you all try this weekly write a simple you know what is this pragma even without fragments going to work so do not worry about it
write some contracts pace sample some bracket function some function braces can you all write a simple thing and compile and see that whether you are able to see this by code and AVI can you all give it a try should do this and click on details
Shailendra Food Corner Rupesh life you are able to run it let me know so rupay she's got a question
Run environment where you see environment Rupesh run this one ok so this one will see so we can run it in a web-based suppose if you want to deploy this contract right so what are contact you are writing this contract you want to reply reply then the real IBM ok you can use it so that is what is in a web 3 provider injected with 300
use parse error so is it the same in a braces please be very careful on the bestest and can you check it out where should I navigate to after a b ok so there a couple of things right so in the compile again I'm sure you so click on details on details
there are two things one is RBI ok so other one is bytecode ok make sense for an did you get it 910 all of you where you all able to compile it so this is just starting thing why you want to show you this is because so all the programs
how are you going to write ok so its all through this web thing you will be writing so one more time please fine not a problem ok so some of your rights so this is a contract we have not written anything said the contract I'll send to everybody so let me start from first ok so others like
you are not able to follow me just just just stop what you are doing just listen for some time remix solidity Browser I have typed in this and then I clicked on the first URL so by default in Odessa pop up blockers what I am going to do with loader sons unsafe scripts ok now what I am going to do this click on this plus button
so here I can create what are the file I want so again I'm creating sample I click on Ok buddy for to change the sample one that's ok so I'm saving and pasting the contract code whatever we have written ok so after that so the next step is we need to compile why we need to compile we need two things to work upon one is a b another one is bytecode so I am clicking on the short start to compile UK
compile so where do I find the details so next to sample you can see something call details button click on it so you can find bytecode and a b which we discussed upon ok so both of it this year make sense okay social
able to get it fine ok um she also got it good girl to ok so if you got it right so basically basic step ok so now or next what you will do it will run this contract you will write some something here we will define different variables and drive so that's why that was our agenda today but anyway it's very difficult to cover everything in the
how about tomorrow morning 7:30 or always ready now we are only left with 5 minutes ok 7:30 find it ok good fine yeah so where were you still I can I just join half an hour before we will look at in on so that we can spend some time on programming
so will give a glimpse of like what we're going to do tomorrow so we are going to look at the language itself so solidity so what is different types of Syntax what is this pragma used for what are imports what are memory storage typical any programming class right how you do like what are the different types of variables what we need to use and stuff like that ok so that is what we will look at it
ok and the first time in a especially someone is very new to programming might find it very difficult no that's okay get to know like basic stuff and all the time once you practice you should be all good ok that's what we're going to see and probably you know this itself will take like 1 and half hours time ok so we will look at this already the programming and we will start with our VMC
like we'll start with doing some exercise ok on our Virtual Machine make sense case any questions so in 5 more minutes is there I'll take up questions even any general questions also not a problem let me know I'll try to answer
good guess should have questions so question from Rakesh solid it is enough to for to work on blockchain not enough Rakesh to know if your know how many years of experience have gotten your back but people what they look is really so now if you asked me like a 1 year
before order in ovary disease before at the time solid it was enough now people as for node JS or some kind of strong JavaScript background ok or rainy to infect know like multiple platforms so one day we will look at fabric also like fabric platform that is going to help question from JSON is blockchain is going to you sorry DP as a platform no only if serum uses solved it
ok if you look at fabric hyperledger fabric it uses even you can use Java okay in fact the core code is written in golang C language golang see but you can use other language also their working on libraries when it comes to ethereum it's only sorry DP Shailendra Mr is already installed unnadira kaviyam I don't think so Shailendra we are not going to use some rest ok if you want to try out in a field
smart contracts or are you going to develop an app when I say I have are you going to develop a web app of you going to develop a mobile app what is that you are going to contribute based on that you know your skills would vary but not mandatory ok so Sudhir question on gas price during ICS investors are told to use Haier gas price for investment to go through this year
that and use gases refunded is it correct why is the use Haier gas prices because mine is good when they choose the transactions right to mind what they do is they have a tendency to choose the transaction which has higher gas price ok so what happens is normally when the ICS is launch they will given they'll be given us time there will be time window where you can contribute ok so some by soyou CET get over in 10 minutes or
maybe half an hour like that in that case if you send a very less transaction fee what happens is minor things to neglect that for a while so you may not go through so that's why they try to push more gas price ok so Sudhir I hope I answered your question so Rakesh playing in the WhatsApp
group Rakesh can you send me your number problem can I do and what is the pragma version that we should use progress and you can use your latest one is 4.20
ok its ok we can use 4.15 4.16 not a problem so whatever stuff we are going to locate in the class right so for that even 4.15 should be fun
yeah so I know that you have given your numbers can you give me with country code or let me send you guys any of you have this WhatsApp web URL Rakesh is +91 sudhanshu's also play +91 how about Farhan
+91 ok fine
is any questions
Shailendra do you want to send your number I just received + 91
91 right of soul and all of you so Shailendra holden for a while how to include library functions will do that but not now ok so the class we can do that ok next class
ok yes thank you all have a good day see you all tomorrow
