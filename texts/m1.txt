hey good morning all of you this is Sunil from edureka team is everyone able to listen me can you hear me in the chat window can you quickly type in yes or no so that I could
ok so fine ok so I got a lot of it but no screen view at yeah I will be sharing it soon
is my screen visible now ok good
so that starts at 8 let's give another name for another 5 minutes so that others could join suggestion says he is not able to see the screen it how would how about others
free saying he's able to see thoroughly is good from Corn is good Jason can you do one thing can you know quickly log off and then or manage just sign out and then can you send back in looks like others are able to see a Shailendra
yeah there is nothing on the screen we have not started it justice just give few minutes
ok no I have not shed my skin I shared my screen but not the content it just dial quickly give an introduction and then get started
aap Sandeep Sandeep is having some issues logging in from is mobile Sandeep and not sure about the mobile problem have to get in touch with the edureka support team
so good morning good evening all of you ok some from wherever you are you know so I am Sunil so I am going to be your blockchain instructor for another rest of the course in up so let me quickly reduce about myself I have around in 11 years of experience in IT industry and trade on firstly I started my career with you know C plus plus
Telecom developer and Meenu Telecom software developer and protocol testing then moved onto networks data warehousing few years I was into big data and then a name last two and half years I am into blockchain ok so from early 2016 is when I started Jain 2016 when I started blockchain so I work for one of the leading MNC where we
blockchain products for customers it is mostly on the private side of ok so I don't have been participated in a few eyes nose and stuff like that but the my full time jobs in to create or work on blockchain platforms which are meant for enterprise ok so this is about me and in terms of our LMS and what we are going to have right so it is more
I like you know I would be a rest of you all of you would be on mute in only I would be speaking all the conversations we're going to have it via chat and you know sometimes if you feel like another chats or even the question is whatever rising the question window and doesn't help then you know we can always I can go ahead and Unmute you so that you can ask question directly ok so why even mute mute all of us because you're just too
you know sometimes I hear noise and stuff like that so you know make sure that it is it's all the same for everybody innocent that's only reason and in terms of questions in as mentioned it's mostly will be on chat window and you know if something we need to discuss in person or you know with audio in probably be mostly at the end of the class and I will take the questions I will not on your questions and it's going to be
the end of the class ok ok so in terms of any difficult if you are having related to animals or if you are in LMS is nothing but the learning management system water from where you know once you login you can see all your course content your assignments you are recorded session innocent in our class right this class completes you just give it likely not to 3 hours of time you will be getting
ok so on what we have done today so all these could be viewed in LMS ok any any technical Glitch or anything related to that you know please contact edureka support team so they work 24/7 ok and there is a dedicated supporting enough for technical team so they would be helping me out so innocent structure I would not be knowing everything in a what's going on with your sister moral the software patches you need something like that
it would be best in a few contact supporting ok ok so that's about it and we have we have Sur from Chandra ok from idiotic card team in he is part of this in our group today so he is going to take care of the VM installation ok so what has happened in the past it would be like you know Institute
seenugadi the team of how to setup the VM and stuff like that but it's taking a really long time because of in multiple issues INOX one maybe having a Mac other one would have a Windows some kind of 50 ok so these supreme have since he has a lot of experience in setting up the network okay the virtual machines so he would be so he is here so what do you want to talk
hello this is insulation and I'll also be helping you out in the course of the whole duration so where after your purse and I'm not able to you alright yes ya so if you have any doubt after the social survey
you can ask me whatever mm installation process as well as in the courses you can always is it a cable support so we can solve it as quickly as possible ok so got a question super like you know what I could you please share the list of software to be installed on Linux RPM so that also you be helping right so I will bring with each and every kind of OS
after the session is over I will forward it to the installation process fine thank you right before 15 minutes we can get connected ok thank you thank you so please so today will I am not we have around 18 members
16 members ok so in our course you know please let me know can you just the tighten the chat window like and what is that basically and your name in fact I'll get the name just your we have a blockchain experience in the past ok and what is that you are trying to get out of this class and if you have some experience like you know you know JavaScript or do you know some experience just in a quick heal
can I know what is the experience we have blockchain experience in the past so if you could tighten the chat window what I would do the end of the class I would compile and make sure like to know who all are in a fitting into what bucket where I should emphasize more so I would do that normally take introduction class but you know since we have a lot of period to be covered I am just recording this process I will do it in
after the class fine so let's let's get started so when I quickly scan through the chat window AC like enough we have enough 5 years we have 20 years experience we had we have a very good mix
ok so that is a cyber security expert Sandeep savita's 22 years of experience very good very nice like we are having very good team okay exposed to C C + + Java Hadoop ok
white mix so how can help me quickly explain like and how we are going to go through this course ok so these are the models in the next 5 weeks we are going to cover each module ok so it is module 1 too and enough to it goes up tonight ok first so first four classes its moral it's it's going to be theory ok
in fact I will walk you through each of it ok to module 1 if you look at module 1 what they going to discuss is what is this blockchain all about people are talking about Bitcoin what is bitcoin and why it is related with blockchain so that is what we are going to see so this will be a highly introduction module to this will in a get focused for the rest of the course ok so this is about module 1 in module to what we will do was so now we got an introduction in module 2
Evil in 12 volt blockchain and she like weather where we can really fit this blockchain in Real world ok so that is what we are going to look at in the module 2 moving on in module 3 we will more focus on how Bitcoin works ok so bit in a bit from Bitcoin only blockchain evolved ok so we will look at like to know what is the role of Bitcoin in how it is closely related with Bitcoin we will go more technical
how things works behind the scenes so that is what we look and module 3 module for you will look at mining has pics ok so what do we need to know in case if you want to find some Bitcoin what we should do and really how today my name is happening Bitcoin mining is happening what are the different types of mining so that is what we are going to see till module for this LOL no till module for it is more of An Introduction and evil
get a Holistic picture of what is blockchain and Bitcoin what are the cryptocurrencies you get Holistic view till module 4 from module 5 Evil deep dive into finding out what is the specifics ok if you look at blockchain there are many platforms available in the market today ok when I started my career it was only theory and some platforms platforms not there anymore or not popular so monitoring am we will do well
call to ethereum ok so we will look at it in concerts at in a partially are made of this class will look at some programming aspects of how to you develop something on top of blockchain OK then in module 6 we will set up something like private blockchain environment using ethereum platform ok so some of you who is wondering like what is ethereum Thorium is one of the blockchain platform OK then going on in the 7th module there is another
beating platform for ethereum not just for ethereum for blockchain itself this is more of an enterprise in for enterprise world OK what is the best suited blockchain platforms ok so that is called hyperledger so we will look into the concept of a pleasure and then will set up something some practical should be there OK in terms of hyperledger then finally we will get into something called multichain this is another blockchain platform
will get into this and end of it we will be having a project work so I don't know them not mentioned here so that is ok the last module is nothing with the prospects of blockchain ok we have learnt about blockchain we have learnt multiple plots platforms where do we where do we in real life where do we where do all this written so that is what we're going to look at in the module 10 and the job job aspects of it
ok and each and every module right so it has assignments if you look at module 1 it has an assignment and it has an end it like when you have to complete ok so what I would recommend this in a innocent when you complete the module if you take up the assignment ok it will be great and there is a due date ok so try to finish it in as soon as possible so that you up to speed when we move to know each and every module it'll be
good you can you will have questions to solve will get answered in in that ok it's over this all about it so here under every Morya look and look at the case studies assignments and stuff like that ok fine then in terms of inertia mention recordings after our class in St Suite 434 hours in a sometimes for 5 hours but you should definitely we'll be able
see all over recordings and this is forever ok so
outing can you hear me or are you able to see my screen hello can I get a Quick yes or no ok ok good sorry I had a technical Glitch
had to reboot my missing ok and in case right through the course of class in case if you know suddenly if my inner voice gets lost or something do not worry I will be back in a minute to minute what happens is sometimes due to internet fluctuations something you know there is a temporary delay ok so do not worry about that I will be right back ok fine yeah yes there is nothing on the screen right now and also what I would
right to give you guys is just created a WhatsApp group ok group invite so let me share that with you
ok no worries I will in a shower before end of the class I can share it not a problem now let's go out and get started so our painter learning material right it is going to be a duracast slide ok and I would be suggesting if there are some you know something like some materials which are good over online and I would be sharing that
ok and I'll be passing you some links and stuff like that ok but most of it it is going to be at your request content ok ok
that's ok the first module what we are going to Look At Us what is basically what is this blockchain all about why we need a system call blockchain and why this is ground breaking mirror breaking technology in that is what we are going to look at in the first module on the first class ok so here that is what they mentioned what is the financial problem with what we have right now why we need a system like blockchain at all so that's what we're going to look at end of it we will see like what are the
types of cryptocurrencies ok so most of you by now you should be knowing about Bitcoin and other coins ok so what is this and what is the intrinsic value over 2 volt I will just touch base on that in to discuss ok so first so what I would you not typically my style of you know teaching is what are you doing I will look at the slide ok and probly I will you know use my notepad to explain stuff you know
if there are any questions I'm going to take a pass and in a great answer then want to the next slide so that so we will be proceeding ok so here right how has money transformed ok done so you be knowing barter system Fiat money digital money gold coins I will quickly give story then will look at
slide okay so previously write in olden days there was no money at all ok so it was all about you know commodity trading or it is called barter system so where you have suppose you have a rice Grover ok and cattle Grover and let's say that there is summer doctor ok so there is a doctor in the commodity what they do is typically the exchange goods bit
one another so that is how things were ok just give me one second I have a good notes let me get that
I don't want to miss anything so that's the reason ok so this is the WhatsApp link let me share it in the group have said couple of times OK once you click on this group you should be able to join
talk so now getting back ok so so here we have a chicken grow rice grow and heart surgeon ok so this is how the community was there was no money nothing ok this is what happened was people exchange goods and that's all they continue their life but there was a major flaw in this type of your system we are going to see what is the major flaw Ok why we need needed something like a currency
show that if you look at these four properties these four properties I know it is nothing but divisibility durability fungibility and verifiability so we'll take one by one what is divisibility okay suppose you want to buy in Islam 1 kg of rice ok 1 kg of rice cost like u want say like 1 kg of rice cause 1 chicken ok that's fine ok so now the rise
Eenadu chicken Grover needs just half kg of rice ok and if he goes to rice grow hair and he says like now I need one second he he cannot cut half a half of his chicken and give it to rise bro that's not going to work ok so this the first problem with barter system divisibility problem ok and II II problem is durability problem what is durability problem that is chicken its like its time bomb right so like an hour and 5 or 6 is equal to die
accident yesterday so he cannot being chicken growing he cannot always live with chickens so that's a durability problem ok and fungibility okay fungibility I'll come come to later ok verifiability verifiability it's you know suppose you have in chickens all chickens are not the same okay one could have got some disease so there is no way that you could physically inspect and identify which one is better want this is a verifiability problem and loss
fungibility fungibility is nothing but ok so say that hard this heart doctor ok he operates and maybe make sure that you know people or Hale and healthy ok and what he claims that was give me some Chicken give me some rice you know in your olden days I will take care of you ok but chicken curry and rice grow hair at young age they are not their own they don't want to believe this heart surgeon ok so they are just ignoring
ok so in this case what happens is that is economical imbalance right so even though he is a heart surgeon he has printer Universe spend a lot of time studying stuff ok he is not rewarded so this is the common problem with the barter system ok so now so only for this reason these are the major reasons ok that of course there will be other reasons to avoid this only money came into picture ok that is money its nothing with me at
Fiat currency so if you look at all this property should be addressed OK what is divisibility if you take $1 or if you take a Rupee it can be divided up to 1 Centre 1 Rupee ok it can it is divisible not a problem at all durability ok until unless you know you damage it if you can take care well it's me know it's going to last forever right so that in case of durability and fungibility it doesn't matter
all the exchange happens via currencies ok so it doesn't matter like in a heart surgeon has to wait till is old is nothing like that his currency can spend it the next one is very February these notes of currency notes are printed by the government ok and it is accepted as legal tender so it doesn't matter that you know it is very verifiable cities where the properties that's how the Fiat currency came into picture
so now if you go look at the slide we can see the first system is called barter system ok so utility minute that some people exchange goods using this party system then came in something called gold coins in fact I directly jump into Fiat currency then something called gold coins before currency came into picture what happened was a Chinese King ok so it was mostly in between India China
that's also first the Chinese King introduce something called gold coins so you give them them some gold coins you get give a commodity you get Gold ok and you people used this gold for transacting OK then again there was a problem gold is again so if you want to say you'll have to carry it I'll have to carry this code that became a problem then Fiat currency came into picture then I know sometime back in early 2003 started all this online bank
I'm going from typical traditional banking and then moved on to something corporate tokens so if you are in India would be knowing all this product so too can talk and Amazon coupons ok so this is all digital movie money now we are moving to Revolution ok decentralized money earn Bitcoins this is a quick history about like you know how things transformed over the period of time any any questions
Mallika has mentioned that there is no audio in the session about others were you able to hear me ok good Mallika can you do you know can you quickly check with edureka support team
same with Shailendra both Shailendra and Mallika was not able to listen looks like Shailendra and Mallika can you both get in touch with red yureka supporting ok Shailendra mentions that you know she is speaking
ok so you know some of you who made join late so you know your audio is all muted ok so all the questions and chats questions are going to go through in chat chat window okay cell indices but session does not have means course material course material to be there enough for now just in holden for sex in case
sperm you know if you are not able to then at the end of the classroom is going to help you out in Vinay Looking through Amazon think that ok to do not worry about it right now just now get let's fox and the Clash ok so Jason can you give me some examples of digital money ok to digital money you know you have a Sodexo card write JSON I don't know if you are from us on our India Sunder ok so is it today if you have Amazon coupon or you
Goodwill store like calls are awesome where you go to the store you get a coupon right you don't get a physical money you get a coupon so now you take this coupon go to some store and then you get redeemed ok you bhaiya you purchase clothes whatever it is right depending upon the coupon so this is digital money so this all happened like in all in last maybe 780 years or maybe even 10 years before that was not there ok
bebas asking whether we can see what questions no we can't do that something about you I would be answering all of your questions ok so do not worry I will just mentioned what is the question and also I'll answer that is ok ok so now what is bitcoin ok so you might be ugly
most of you would have heard about Bitcoin ok so so Bitcoin was the first digital currency ok so digital decentralized currency ok for now just understand that we will see like why Bitcoin is required right now ok so we have one I can say that in a fiat currency ok understand that there was a problem with the barter system ok now we are into Fiat currency in so what is the problem with Fiat currency why do I need a bitcoin at all so
will look at that ok so I'll just give a hint about it and then will look at blockchain ok so here what happens is so we have seen barter system we have seen Fiat currency how it works ok and we have online buy banking and coupons like that right so now we are talking something called Bitcoin why it is required ok so for that I would like to set two examples ok one example you can look at
Bobby ok see if you look at currency rate in general if you look at the currency currency it's all about trust you have faith in your government that they develop policies right they print right amount of currency in of the calculate and print right amount amount of currency for circulation so that demand and supply is calculated right so you basically a citizen has a faith in the government that the government is doing
ok so let us take an example Zimbabwe some example if you look at Zimbabwe in I believe in years may be wrong but an hour somewhere in 1984 EP 810 Bobby and dollar was equal and 21 US dollar OK then what happened that was lot of Summer in internally their government collapsed and now zimbabwean I think $500,000 is equal and 21 US dollar ok
very good story about it like one person in Zimbabwe ok maybe its peak she is but the story could make you relate why we need something like Bitcoin ok so what you did as he had a lot of wealth in Zimbabwe she had lot of cattle she had lot of forms what it is like you know he would you sell all the stuff and he would like to go settle in some other country like same stage ok so what day does he sold all of his wealth lans Castle and everything
sold and in return he got some 1 million or 1.5 million worth of some zimbabwean dollar when he takes she is trying to go to states and goes and give it to the forex foreign exchange that they say was your 1million zimbabwean dollar is equal to only $13 in US ok so that you know that is the both so what he had he had lot of cattle a lot of worms is a very wealthy person ok he he
nothing wrong he just you know he had a fit and is government lucas' reason he whatever he has he did it was alright ok but due to internal class what happened he know it was just $2000 work ok then he Mera he couldn't even travel 2 States with with this flight ticket rate flight ticket cost more than this is I will give you another example ok look at in Afghanistan war Iraq war
ok sometime something like Siri are so what happens if its the country's political stability is not good you know there is a very good chance of Vinod valuation of currency would go down to rupee you all know what happened in world war what happened to German mark currency rate would have seen pictures in there were in the streets and things like that ok so
and another example is like around now we say in a no offence like we can save people say that in all states has given like 1 or 10 million dollars to Afghanistan ok or Afghanistan and Iraq as of funds printing all these currency is there is there is always like this demand-supply was calculated ok so this all these problems okay is
going to be addressed by Bitcoin to Bitcoin in a look at Bitcoin it is created in an Ocean like a world currency why should you have something called you know US dollar specific to only US why Indian National Rupee for only a Pound for Pound for UK let's have some common currency called Bitcoin and how the demand and supply is calculated we will look into that detail that is why
you know the person who created because I'd say that is the whole concept of big and creating Bitcoin ok any quick questions okay I see a question from Anand one problem is fake currency can be created and very good one so that is and other things like someone can create a fake currency but not in case of Bitcoin is a very good one so that's why this Bitcoin came into
ok sunao defining blockchain ok so that you're getting into blockchain ok so for this also what I would have first look at this example do not going to each lines but we're just getting started OK what is happening is so blockchain is nothing but you make a transaction ok and that goes as a block and the next transit
goes inside the block ok so this keeps on coming so that is blockchain for this also I will give you another example ok this is just imagine that you have a Facebook account OK your Facebook account ok ok currently FB is not run on blockchain but in Facebook its very easy way to Anna
can I make people understand using this Facebook ok so what you are going to do if you are going to share something let's say that hello everybody everybody said welcome 2018 so this is the message ok so what are you going to do it so let's say that this is from Facebook account person let me think I'll take my name ok so what I do if I login to my Facebook account and I say I post this message on my wall
hello everybody 20-20 2018 ok and what are you doing Aisha Aisha it on my wall now what happens is if you look at you know just do not consider blockchain what happens really is used in you whatever you post right it's on your wall your friends and your associated friends or whoever wants to come to your profile can come and see like what your post on your wall ok but if you want you can suppose I think like an hour
I shouldn't have posted this I can go back and deleted now when someone else looks it right imagine some kind of a system ok Facebook I have posted like hello everybody 2018 ok moment I post this message this has been shared indefinitely across all the Machines all the Facebook account Honours was having this message has been propagated
ok so it means like let's say that we have Anand we have Shailendra ok like that what happens is let's take three or four part is ok and unsigned and Jacob ok so what are you do it let's take just for parties for simple example what happens is moment I share something this goes to this machine to Anand and Anand can be wit Anand machine Shailendra Jacob and it propagates Infosys
propagates to everybody ok now now what happens everyone has a copy ok now now if I delete something if I go and delete hello everybody 2018 still there is a copy with Anand with cylinder and Jacob ok so in fact in blockchain wallet cannot delete ok so so this is nothing but an high level this is called blockchain OK what you do is ok face
example you might ask me like you know I suppose if I want to delete ok that's fine ok just take this Facebook as an analogue ok do not consider in a Facebook is the only thing ok so basically what I am trying to convey here is once you have a message these messages right so at this moment say like another person has said Hi when I said Hola and go on Ok namaskar something
the messages at that given point of time I've been group and add a to A block ok so this all say that it is all loving grouped under Block 1 so this will go on the Block 1 ok and next said of messages will go on the block 2K 16 technicals will look into it but high level so some transaction ok so this could be hello everybody 2018 or this could be something like your transacting a bitcoin like suppose you are sending 5 Bitcoins to
person 5 BTC from bobs transferring to Charlie ok so this is a transaction whatever it is OK some of the transactions whatever is done right to do SOL framed into a block and so the next stage of transaction next blog and it goes on forever ok and this blog will be there in all the Machines ok so this is a very important. Ok so this blog what I am saying
this will be in Anand machine this will be in Shailendra S machine jackets machine and my machine and goes on and the next Ed of my messages will be blocked too then it goes on forever so this is nothing but blockchain high level are you getting the Crux of it will ok question from Dharani will one block have only one transaction record of more than one that could be many transactions
ok many transaction that's why I mentioned like you know there is hello everybody there is a whole lot of messages are group inside a block ok ok next question from Shailendra how to decide start and end of the transaction in the block so these are technical details the how to start you know what is the first transaction so that we will in a look and then the subsequent classes another question from Anand will there be block oneplus block to Exeter on my machine yes there will be
you'll have all the blocks that's not a duplication Ok why does not replication is because she blocked one will have different set of message ok so supposed this is blocked one so this is blocked one ok so the question is if I have block 1 Block 2 is it duplication know because block II will have a totally other set of messages so this is hello everybody 2018 ok someone would have message like hello it's totally I suppose I am sending
message ok hello 2017 so this will be my next to block this are the next to block ok so this block will be only once in my machine make sense Anand really answer the question what is my machine is out of out of memory ok so that
other things like you know you can ask me like you very good question he is asking like you know what is my mission is out of memory ok so there are things ok once you move on right and then the next class or something like that will see like where you can store your data party outside ok can have only header information so it is more of a technical details ok so that it is taken care ok suppose if you have a memory constraint you can do that
ok so Sudhir question from Sudhir can we see the contents of all the blocks know you cannot see you know you know that some transaction has happened but you will not be able to see all the contents of it ok so then because if you are able to see all the contents then it becomes a privacy issue right that's the reason it will all be encrypted so question from penis
how many transaction can one block hold hold it could be multiple it depends upon the blockchain platform you use if you look at it I really like Bitcoin it holds up mm mm transactions then will a copy be there in all the users yes you know every machine ok who is connected to the internet ok using this blockchain will have a copy of it
okay provide other options like whether you want to run the full load partial load ok so that we will get into class number 3 ok Sort the time you will know that suppose in as an invention if there is a disconnect constraint you can have a partial can I open full information Mallika I think it is also up to in a question is about space I think I answered about space any questions on this
constraint were you able to get it so ja Rani what is the capacity of 1 Block how many transaction is sold UK so block size depends upon platform to platform ok Bitcoin says like block size is 2 MB ok or 2.5 MB ok so it has a bigger size or smaller size depends upon the platform platform what be developed question from what is the size of 1 Block in blockchain
yeah I'm pretty Khesari mention it depends it changes from platform to platform ok I'll I'll show you when I can show you the size exactly ok question from silencer do you have a database to store know these are technical details in how old is getting stored what is the Dab a database the use internal I will show you that for now what I want you to understand this this is some kind of a transaction which are logic
group in a block to insert physical group in the block and block by block it is getting store ok so quickly so it is timestamp like you know at a given time this is first block in I'm suppose this is today is 1st block tomorrow at we are 10 minutes once you can say that this block happened like you know 8 o'clock this one happened at 8:10 8:20 and so on so chronological order by first come first block it's that kind of thing and very
think about blockchain as it is immutable OK you cannot go and change the this block okay blocks value this is not possible why it is not possible we will get into it ok like to know what happens when someone changes Ok why does immutable will get into it ok for now what I want you to understand that this is a chronic chronologically it is ordered ok and it is all so don't try on and it is all we know cryptographically signed ok so each one right so
when you make a transaction in we look that this Facebook lite Facebook as an example just like that I can't post this message ok I should have something some username and password to post a message right as like you do it in Facebook you have a username and password so in in Bitcoin world it is digital signature ok you should have public and private key which we will again seen in the class
ok so few more questions have got how system maintains relations between each block technical details we will get into it like I know there is hash hash in connection with another hash ok just hold on probably look at in today's class only till end of class
user transaction this is from Mohit when you say transaction is broadcasted but we don't have a master node how does it no like which all clients the transaction should go there is no masternode here it is a peer-to-peer network Mohit ok it will go to all the notes it will be propagated so you know just me down for two three slides OK I will show you that how old is getting propagated love it we'll be able to decrypt that block if not everyone Veneno
I would be able to decrypt ok so it is known to be able to decrypt ok so it is like it contains information it contains basic level of information like was sent transaction to whom that level of details are exposed ok but other than that critical details are not exposed what is the maximum blocks we can have there is no limit ok so if you look at bit
when it is still going it started from 1st block and I think we are in $500,000 you know it goes on ok next question from Anand is it atomic say if half of the block one is more to my machine and I disconnected no it is atomic when I say block you will be receiving the block only you will not be receiving partial block so cousin from Mohit so it is a distributed Network and no one is registering tour
Austin order anything no it is a distributed peer to peer network how question from Mallika how is a cryptocurrency and other blocks different Bitcoin DNA Bitcoin itself is on blockchain ok so you're not the cryptocurrency and cryptocurrency and blocks cryptocurrencies using blockchain Ok so just hold on now came Mallika like you like to 3 slides you should be clear
how does the transaction broadcast work movie theater I'll show that what time it is consuming like IST USA I think it's GMT Shailendra GMT or when will be when will a block be called cryptocurrency know so block will not be called as a cryptocurrency just hold on for a while Malegaon will come to not ok then else what's the adoption of blockchain Technology
currently adoption adoption like you know if you look at cryptocurrencies blockchain Technologies adopted if you look at Bitcoin blockchain Technology adopted ethereum blockchain technology and all other cryptocurrency right most of it is a blockchain technology adopted in enterprise case there are few scenarios if you take hyperledger fabric as a platform they are trying to in for supply chain for other details that trying to adopt
blockchain Technology ok so question from Savita is there no administrator who is made in the entire blockchain know that is a beauty of it you are going to see that yeah you know looks like that are in a lot of questions from CD remember feeling like that a lot of questions okay so let's that's ok for the first class right Tripoli what happens if we get a lot
questions like you get excited like you know what you know most of your questions whatever was astrodunia get answered so no worries ok yes I know let's hold on for a while question is what is the difference between blockchain ethereum solidity ok let's we are not there at the most of your questions right like and I know that you are into the next level light
good to see that you are thinking next but just hold on forever so blockchain techno Tech chronic shift ok so what they're trying to do I mean defeating is like where we are right now and where we are trying to go so now you see that is a lot of hyper on blockchain where we can adopt what is the use case that's why in 2023 what they are thinking a sinner most of the Government companies
you know supply chain feel out of place this blockchain technology would be in a bed like a internet right like how everyone uses internet like that blockchain is going to grow and after certain period of time it is going to be mature ok so that is so that's about it and hear what they saying yes then after the blockchain tipping point and social tik impact like
alright I'm you might of heard about smart cities okay lot of sensors now you can see lot of you know we can smart washing machine Smartwatch lot of things right so going for that there is going to be a lot of sensors like this like a lot of small devices which are going to communicate with Internet ok so all these are going to be going to be a big boom ok like how we have smartphones are going to be lot of devices communicating with the network ok with the for that
the blockchain would be used and 2025 it is this LOL prediction ok this could go wrong ok so so next to understanding Economics of nothing but in all the things like cryptocurrency will be mainstream that's the prediction Smart City and Bitcoin is going to or 10% off will be on Bitcoin technology or nothing with blockchain technology so that much is going to change the revolution ride if you see something like this
so that is all about the prediction ok ok so now or later studies 9 o'clock mum since we have already had a quick tasty quick 5 minutes break normally we have like 2 bricks ok let's now it's 9 o'clock let's take it 5 minute break and then let's catch up this is ok
Hatim back so hope all of your back now we will look into how trading happens in current system ok so why we need system like blockchain ok
will look at that ok for this I am going to give you an example this is remittance example suppose ok have got $2000 ok and in back of America and you would like to transfer to India State Bank of India ok and today is say that Indian National Rupee exchange rate values 65 no for simple example I am taking 65 rupees ok
sofa some of you right INR is nothing but Indian national be like USD ok Indian currency suppose if you want to transfer $2,000 to State Bank of India what you need is basically if you exchange rates 8000 all you have to do is you'll have to multiply in 265 you get 65000 rupees in State Bank of India so that deserve it has to work right so what happens is in real time scenario that you know it doesn't work like
ok so what happens is so suppose if you want to initiate a transfer from Bank of America to State Bank of India UK Bank of America will tell you that in a while have to go through lot of process in transferring funds from US to India and I cannot give you 65 I will give you rates 63 ok just I'm giving some random number then why this you have no other choice right now so are then what will happen is you'll have to leave
so at the end of it you get 63000 rupees ok so that is what would get transferred say that the other way is only that this the only way right this is only solution and What happens behind the scenes is so Bank of America would transfer funds to Federal bank office okay so this all happens be in the scenes we don't know what is happening ok and
intern Federal Bank will tell that you know please transfer funds to State Bank of India so so once account and that will be sent to RBI ok and Reserve Bank of India would send the first Bank of India then it goes to the account holder ok so this is all process takes place ok this is how the settlement happened ok so so far all these what what happens is in the end what is happening used as a
ok so blood banks do whatever they want ok ultimately I am losing I am losing like November 2015 2000 rupees I'm losing and another thing if you look at it is time consuming ok take sometimes back in a right now you may you be using services like zoom ok that those settlements happens behind the scenes it is taking it sometime ok but you are getting it fast but really if you see
it is a time consuming process ok normal if you transfer from Bank of America it will take at least 3 or 4 days and another thing is it is not open all you get is you get the messages like you know what is happening your transaction is in progress and you got delivered those messages you get it but you don't know like you know when Bank of America transfer to Federal Bank whether this was initiated here all those details are not open until ok ok
if you are transferring from Bank of America to Chase Bank ok Chase bank and United States only entrance $1,000 you might feel like the transfer happen immediately right you ask for $2,000 in INR transferred and initiated it's all done OK user your happy ok behind the scenes what happens if there is reconcillation happening which happens every night out sometime during the weekend okay so they settle amount between Bank of America and 80s man ok today what will happen if you
$10,000 immediately there is some notification and Chase Bank will deposit $2,000 it is not like that the funds has moved from Bank of America to Chase Bank that happens during reconsilation process OK so the main problem what is the main problem you are losing Commission it is time consuming I was not open you don't know what is happening behind the scenes it is like you are just sending the money and just now I'm just having faith in the bank that yes they will get delivery delivery
so that is the current that is all the current system works ok so here if you see an offline ledger where transaction details or so that is nothing but that reconcillation what I was mentioning ok so this bookkeeping what their done it's not open to public OK so the middleman like you be after state Federal Bank RBI this banking communities that they would make sure that our friends essay so so
oblum what is the problem have seen that it is taking fees nothing at the commission ok and cost like you know you are for maintaining all the systems if you look at from the banking perspective ok not an end user perspective he looked in the banking bankers perspective spending a significant amount all in all this infrastructure moving from funds from here to Federal Bank Federal Bank to other bank Reserve Bank Reserve Bank to hear you know a lot of things are happening right so that is banker's problem
ok under see you if you want to send $2,000 its fine suppose if you want to save send $1 ok first of all Bank of America will not allow you to send $1 that is not going to happen at all and that's another from these are some of the promises are slow and it does not have transfer transparency in stuff like that ok and Central authority can use power so that is supposed tomorrow Bank of America says I cannot give you 63 rupees I can give you
60 rupees you have no other choice you will have to live with it right so these are all the problems with the current system so what can be a possible solution like a quick you did it strike in a the current solution did it strike your mind so basically as inducer what I would think I don't want to pay this cost Ok why cant and it should be fast write these are the my as inducer this will be my basic needs and that should be
trust that is important it is not like you know you send it and then you know you'll have to pray to God that your money would reach that should not be the case you should have peace of mind you should have a list commission and another thing should be open it in any questions
movie on ok so these are the main problem so now how we are going to solve this problem is so there are like different models ok so this was a centralised system so like one bank you all interact with bank and Bank helping out some Central a system service centre lies I'll give you very good example next week I'm became decentralized solution that is ok if I have one server it is a problem if I have answer
then probably if my server goes down for example ok so this is Bank of America server and if if it goes down then you know what I could do so then they became something like a decentralized network like that is multiple parties will have some centralisation Power here these are some of the notes which have some centralised powers ok like you can imagine like you know like Bank of America multiple servers even if this goes down again you can use
access the next model is a distributed model I think Mohit Shailendra me of you had questions right about this analysis this answer ok I'll give an example also so this is a distributed network ok so this is like no one is owner so no there is no Central server everybody is linked to everyone ok so for this I'm going to give you a quick example
early 2000 Nokia or for that matter 1999 ok so 1999 if you want to download a song from internet what you do was suppose abc.com you got abc.com and then you look for some songs I like some song ok ok like someone ok so you want to download the song on what you do if you log into abc.com and then you start downloading it okay 1
one fine day what happens is abc.com goes down ok and you wanted to download song to you log into abc.com you say that you know my say what does not exist in our some some message you get any on options right if you want to download a movie same thing you go to one side that site is down know that way you can do anything then in early 2013 maybe in 2003 by then something
f****** this was Revolution something called Torrent came into picture ok so I hope you guys most of you would be aware of Torrent ok no Torrent concept is like block and only decentralized distributed network that is suppose you have this ABC you have the song one what will happen if you install this Torrent software it will be interacted or linked with every participant in the network ok
what happen is this song one will be present as part of in Ace machine and it will be also in peace machine ok now she is trying to download ok from hear from you know basically is time to download song one what happens is in fact he gets down he download from two places it gets download partially from a partially from be and it goes on suddenly what happens
machine ready machines used machine is switched off ok its turned off still she has no issues he can download the song from be machine because we machine is still active ok can you get a glimpse of what is distributed just imagine ok you can think like only two systems that imagine like there are thousands of systems which has the song one ok so even if 500 machines goes down still you would be able
download the song one ok if it was in the centralised case you always have to rely on abc.com if it's not coming up your screwed ok there is no way you could download the song so if you look at distributed it the copy is everywhere everyone has a copy so you can get downloaded make sense any questions this important concept I want all of you to get it can I get
yes or no ok so blockchain has taken this concept that is like taken this concept public key concepts hashing concepts and dinner together it is called blocking question from foreign
distributed system is not better than decentralized or vice versa ok distributed system is better OK what we are saying yes you know your questions why distributed system is not better known as the cleanest distributed system is a better system make sensor on question from Tarani is blockchain is based on business analyst dispute distributed
ok so this is another example ok so someone some of you like he was with a weird questions like how it is getting propagated and questions like that right so it is just imagine abc.com example in Sorry song example just like that you upload song What happens is this imagine this will be sent to everybody ok
Forbidden all machines so in typical if you look at blockchain world what is happening is suppose you make a transaction you send it here you send it here you send it here again this would get propagated so the block you will be in installing a piece of software on your machine ok so that will take care of propagating between pairs ok you make a transaction you probly suppose if you are working with Bitcoin what do you do if you will have a bitcoin wallet ok with that wallet you would be sending something this goes
here and it is propagated to all the notes network ok make sense did you so this is our gift propagated ok question from Mohit I have installed but I have installed I have become core installed on my machine ok
how does it know who all to broadcast ok so that the software take care of it ok so once you install your Bitcoin core wallet right what happens is it will try it is a protocol like you know just imagine like what happens today with internet so immediately it tries to ping the next machine what are the next to know its send something messages and tries to find out who my next machine is and then communicate if you said something to internet
how goes it apps from one machine to another machinery likewise SIM lock and can so will solve your network connected in network ok so it can you can find the next machine the software take care of it so question from Shailendra suppose I want to not get a few message from on specific sender can we do not stop no we can't do that
ok so you not get a direct message in fact you can all the message would be propagated there is a option of whether you want to have full load partial load so that will talk in the in a third class okay Shailendra just wait till the third class so question from JSON without the software the machine will not be considered as a no no it will not be
yes that's it so on and so forth yes for her know there's a lot of decentralized exchange are opening on blockchain or this not distributed these are distributed to KFC typically in the blocks in world ride more than calling distributor the called decentralized the reason being right so they want to just the actual term should have been distributed Ok why they are saying this analysis
RBI some party who is hosting the network suppose if you look at the decentralized exchange so question from for and is there is decentralization so decentralized exchange exchange created by someone that become centre is there but still it runs on a distributed system will come there in AVR not there it okay Anand Kumar what software I will show you and a leg decentralized network
also allows multiple user to access the same. That's right yeah ok so moving on so distributed ledger technology is where we are this is a hurry overview ok so then I don't want to get into the details of it so if you look at the infrastructure layer you can use your machine or you can have a few
if you want to keep your stuff in cloud that is also possible ok if you have a nose machine that is possible ok so these are all the infrastructure providers so the next one if you look at platform providers like um ok we have looked that if theory I'm so these are some of the open platforms ethereum in fact this also has to be so these are open like that are blockchain platforms which are closed only for banks ok so those are something called
R3 TV show the different types of platforms and Technology is depending upon the use case ok and Enterprise chiffon enterprise things I don't want to go fully public yes there are platforms if you want to be fully open yes there a platform ok and each platform comes up with the different consensus mechanism what is consensus wheels look at in this class ok so there are different types of algorithms which is used by different platforms in this class we will look at what is proof of work ok
and these are all behind the Hood what is happening OK when it comes to end user it is all about so what are the use cases basically I not trade finance OK what we have seen right now is cross border payments there are lot of use cases ok so most talked is banking ok surprising ok so these are the ones which are you not since I am
Enterprise to these are these have more waited it is our people are doing a lot of money to develop something out of it this is about it so we will be in our course we will be looking at it haram will be looking at multi ledger Nano college and we will just touch base upon Intel Sata
question from mum she can explain more about the slide ok so I'll just again I'll introduce old is basically right who basically like blockaded when you look at blockchain ok if you want to develop something on blockchain what are the typical use cases so these are some of the use cases here in application use cases so where you are going to use for exam
sometime back we spoke about remittance right you are Trance in friends from US to India so that is nothing but cross border payments likewise there are a lot of use cases ok so these are the ones and above that you see industry Consortium so this is nothing but Consortium is group of people they form like ok blockchain we understand that a very good technology it's all fine but they have specific focus areas ok if you look at the group called R3 ok so they work on
banking related to use cases ok how does blockchain can help banks ok anything related Financial Institutions they come up with a Consortium so these are the Consortium so the below 3 right it is more of a infrastructure setup ok we need what hardware you want you know how you want to interact with it so that is one so this platforms is ok ok when you say blockchain let's takes suppose if you want to you know if you have inventory
is opposing your it is manufacturing in inventory its manufacturing unit and you have some inventory managing mechanism you can go for Oracle CRM you can go for SAP or you can build custom software enough for your needs on a possible right but you have options you can go for SAP Oracle CRM it is possible right like face you have different platforms are you can go for it sorry I'm you can go for fabric allow to find out which one suits your needs and then we'll have to pick and
ok so currently will look at this like these are the things and in fact it is more than this platform serving develop period answer the question at space what another didn't get your question pdpl I don't know the eggs
mention of it we will touch base something ok so will will look at it again ok we will look at in this thing right we will look at it really will look at multi change you look at hyperledger all these in fact we looked at practicals ok ok question is few things are connected to bluemix but not
tws that's my doubt ok so what happens is bluemix right so bluemix if you want to run if you want to run a blockchain OK so if you want to run the blockchain network ok so bluemix IBM bluemix provides you a way you could integrate you can select the notes and you can deploy create 16 for you make sense
ok with answer question one thing looks like he's a w s won't provide like people are competing writer billionaires now they are trying to provide something called ethereum bar setting in Attic remember something like that they're trying to provide right now you see there coming up it is very new HD blockchain platform is evolving so these are tomorrow there is
Microsoft interfacing Microsoft Azure is a Microsoft is trying to come up with something called coco Framework OK it is evolving for right now these are the platforms ok so I think what is missing on infrastructure ladies open network like Bitcoin ethereum running or not maintained by volunteers yeah that is missing yeah this silly
biscuit there's try to cover different things Mallika can you call it how creating a block and this slide parallely so creating a block right so nothing but if you use a platform here so good question like what he is wat Mallika questions like can you take a platform here and see live
mention like how block is created ok so later say this is a cross border payment ok and you are making a transaction OK so the for this transaction you up using platform Lake IIT area OK then what happens if you make a transaction this is Thorium blockchain platform will make sure that that a block is formed ok and this block will be propagated to the underlying fertilizers hard disk like you know it gets propagated ok make sense high level
Mohit will you would we be talking about all the consensus mechanism yes not all but at least 5 to 6 consensus mechanism will be done about showcase I movie on so let's see how a District 9 transaction happens okay so we'll take a real time example here and see
how this transaction happens in the Bitcoin world ok we have talked about Bitcoin ok transaction blockchain Laxman how would you happen we'll see look at here here to James burrows games here James is transferring some money to Kevin ok see here it is there are no banks here ok there are no banks so the coins which are depicted here is all Bitcoins okay supposed James won't send send something to Kevin I really you know
world when the current situation how it can happen is either James has to physically take his funds go to Kevin and handover to him or use some payment mechanism is like banks something like that and transactions in these are the only way he could transfer funds are not between two parties right now in the distributed world ok I let's say that there are no banks
now question comes into mind that you know if it if I send a transaction you know how it will go to Kevin and dea is it safe ok so all those things cool validate that you have whatever I sent it correct to those questions me you know you may get rid of got it ok will look into that ok so this is another curiosity cloud what all questions oh my god okay how to verify me know whether really I have money whether did I insert those transaction
ok solve those things we will see so question is isn't this a decentralized system network model from coconut is a distributed model ok so if you look at here it's cell completely distributed ok but there are some special notes here ok we'll talk about that who are validating it ok
will look into that but that doesn't mean that it is completely decent list so it is select in don't get confused between the centralised and distributed ok basically that is no Central authority so that's what we were going to look in the blockchain world ok there are like banks there are no one who could centralise something like I only can do this ok so I will have to validate the transactions not like that
ok here in the Bitcoin world if suppose if you later transaction you can you know I can set up a computer in you can vary transaction ok ok first ok so any setting transaction first we'll see like how a transaction is initiated for initiating any transaction right ok I will directly go to the
practicals I don't remember that ok so this is my wallet
I have some like $10 worth of it so ultimately what you should have us you should have work if you want to send a transaction ok you should have you should possess something called public key and private key without this public key and private key you will not be able to make any transactions by default OK your address whatever unlike bank account if you look at your bank account is it should be exam 07 some numbers will be the
awesome ok likewise if you look at in blockchain world ok or in the Bitcoin world it is all will be address his end of it what do you do is at the end of this class what I wanted to do is take a look at the site blockchain that info okay probly most of you might have already looked into it ok so if you look at here so these are the blocks which are happy
right now ok so we are in the five hundred thousands block 512 started from zero to block and we went on EP 25 151 2830 block and these are the transactions in the inside the block ok so someone has me like what is the size of the block what will be the number of transactions see here this block has 501 transaction the other block 1000 transactions there is a limit but these are the transactions and other questions as one
what was the number of transaction and what is the size of the block you see the size of the block here is some 1 MB mm cable equals to 1 MB right so like so this is the size of the block this could increase also ok and these are the transaction switch off happened ok so if you look at this transaction ok so this transaction has send money to this person ok from this address it is sent
this person ok normally if you look at your Bitcoin address right you have something like this ok so your address is nothing but your public key OK will get into what is public and private key you will have to have two things to participate in the blockchain network ok that is your public key and private key will see what it is question from Jason Kander block B more than 1 MB yes you will have to
I'll show you here then maybe another block which has more than this is who controls the size ok these are having 511 transactions ride we look at some block which has all of 2000 it is look at this 1000 943 ok if you look at here there is 2232 transactions ok and the size
no it is little over 1 MB there right 1.1 MB problem ok so that is size in the white paper it is mentioned like what is the exact size and what could be the maximum and everything ok so these things keep changing previously it was 1 MB was the max size OK then they had something called I don't know if you guys heard about something called fork Bitcoin for cash so that they increase the size size like it ok
super scene from heroine who controls the size so there is a community if you look at this Bitcoin even though it this is open and everything someone writes software like how this thing should work right how does Bitcoin platform should work What should be the size of the block how many transactions should should contain ok solve these are programmed ok please open source ok so once there is a group of developer community so they all interact together and come up with
illusion day propose to the community and people accept or reject based on that no that's how it works there is no Central authority like if you look at Microsoft Microsoft can release tomorrow version 11 ok windows 7 windows 12 like that there is nothing like that you like you typically like Linux OK what happens with Linux is they get in all the inputs open source and then finally a group of people they think that whether this is required not required and then go ahead with
choti Lekar was unable to decode written in red colour how will take a look at this one class completely for not one class when will spend some time here basically what I want you to knows you're not here in this example when they sit public and private key ok so these are the couple of things which are required for you to make any transaction blockchain ok
question from Sudheer during 4th or any changes their down time for blockchain that is not Downtown what they do is they fixed block size ok from block 500 ok there will be a fork ok so then the software is plugged in such a way that when display block is encountered UFO that it is there is no downtime
ok now will quickly looked at public key and private key OK what is it all about ok ok yes that is a couple of things I want you to show you ok this one will look at blockchain take that block this is my blog it is not enough fully complete actually ok some so there are some
Cryptography basics if you want you can take a look ok so so now I will give an introduction but for more understanding take a look at it ok if I have read Eureka also has provided material you can look at that ok so I have given some examples like to know what happens in scenario once in a day or two it itself is a bit topic so take a look at it and
ok now let me get to quickly reduce about quickly give an introduction about public private key and then I will taken questions okay so that is something called public key and private key and public key is nothing but like your house address ok just imagine it is your house address ok you can give it to anybody ok so they can send a post private key it is it should be safe guarded by you only you can
on the key and take the details on clicking suppose someone has posted something on your Facebook ok so you have the keys only you can take it out ok so that is something like privately publicly you give it to people ok and now I want to touch base on a little bit about encryption ok if I have notes
nope I'm I can create ok so there is something call symmetric encryption ok this is a very basic encryption suppose you have KBC ok and you have agreed upon the symmetric key that is here let's say that Bob wants to send some message to Alice ok by sending some message to Alice so the message is ABC
what is saying is there having asymmetric key so nothing but Bob says that Bob when he sent this message he will increment by 1 so that means it goes as b e f u k and l l is what he does this mean what she does is serial 61 - 1 and then she gets a PC this is symmetric encryption and there are a lot of problem sources with that ok someone can if someone can find the keys they could know all the information OK then can the public key and private key concept
ok still our emails lot of things are working based on public private key and it is full proof since at least from Manan some 2038 ok so public key and private key suppose I have something called this private key 0x 123 is my public key and private key is SAP of you just pbc no cancel this my private key ok so I can do it if
if I send a message ABC okay using my private key ok I'll have to like I know digitally signing ok I am using my private key and encrypting this message only way it could be recovered is using my public ok want to know now my public key to decrypt this message okay suppose if I use my public key to encrypt this message ok I should know the private key to decrypt
ok it works either ways ok so this is the basic level of lake in what is public I want you to just remember this house example you give your house address to everybody and private key you have it on the road we know you have it with you I just called asymmetric encryption ok for more details ok definitely would like to know like more more details go through this and also add yureka has a content about
this public key private key take a look at it when sometime and you know yet not ok so this is it you can show in if whenever I mention this is because when you want to make some transaction in Bitcoin world you are going to do that using your public private key ok so now the question comes like OK when you say public private key where the Stored it is stored in her wallet ok
USA what is a wallet all those things will see ok we will install in the third class you will install a wallet you will look at what is your public key we will look at will go find what is or private key in this Class VII you'll not concentrate on that okay 3rd class will install that and see what is happening ok so see here so this is the this is nothing but a public to hear if you don't called as public you say that it is an address so so this is it
if someone is sending you know just imagine this is a very good one ok so what I mentioned here is when I ok now Bob is encrypting using encrypted using bobs public ok so only way this could be
1 days using private key using box private key is only that is the only way to open so that is why people say that when you lose your private key all the funds are lost ok so this is your public and if you don't have your private key you will not be able to spend those funds make sense so it works on this public key and private key algorithm
makes sense any quick questions days let me know question from Mohan if I want to make my machine as one node I will face any memory issue if transaction increase yes you will face issues yes
phone so you'll have to plan accordingly ok so what is going to if I'm going to run a full not what is your current size what should I plan and only then you'll have to set up a full note question from Mohit if encryption is two ways I mean if I can encrypt using private key and public key of receiver why is it recommended to not share the private key suppose
you have funds in your you know your public send funds to you if you shave your private key he can take the funds out right so that's why you don't share your private Anand what was the folk you mentioned focus like in a let's discuss in the third class okay Bitcoin ok so now let's not get into that not required also Shailendra public key means address always correct
inside his wallet address amis publics they both are same wallet address and public key both are one and the same you can Bitcoin world you don't have enough someone is asking in it is good to add someone's account number right inside can you share me your public key doesn't sound good ride so synonym it's nothing but the public Karan about private key with the private key be unique
for every transaction no no no no see your public and private key always PCM ok so let me once again go through this ok now will take the same things instead of ABC will say that Bitcoin as an example ok so it makes sense okay so bobs public use 0x 123
ok now baubles telling a list that allows you can send funds to my new to this address this my account address please send funds then what else does is Alice send funds to Bob OK what she does is she is sending 5 Bitcoins ok I listening 5 Bitcoins ok to Bob's public remember this is nothing but public your account address
ok now how Bob can take this take this 5 Bitcoins and use because it is sent to use public key or account address the only way you can spend this to know the private key ok only if he knows his private key he will be able to spend this 5 Bitcoins if he loses his private key then its gone forever you will not be able to use it make sense so that is why you should not share your private
suppose allyssa send your 5 Bitcoins and Bobby sharing to Sunil so is sharing it to me that it is my private key so what are you doing I can go and takes 5 bit concerned send someone it's ok and another question like you know what question I got us for every transaction is public key and private key different know okay public key and private key is a pair of keys which is always same ok so for this 0 1 1 2 3 4 the private key is zero
56 ok so this is a pair of keys install not change in this will not change forever suppose there is a public key called 0968 for this there will be different type private key but this right this will never change makes sense okay so I got mail from Mallika Dennis
show Mohit to BTC Centre public and can be transferred from that wallpaper of private Campbell Wiki only using private key that that's right yeah that's right move your understanding is write any other questions did MS Dhoni did you get it Sudhir I hope I answered your question wallet address is same as public but people call it a wallet address
ok how these ki would be generated this is a just an example private key small right this is I am just giving an example you will really look at how your private keys are public keys are generated what is the real ki will look like we will see that ok and lovika how this is would be generated so the protocol will provide you ok when you when I say that
right when you install a software a piece of software in a machine you can request for one side we will create one in the third module will create one you can then your home you can try this is a practical question from Sudheer if individuals all private keys when an exchange gets health how they get away with funds good question Sudhir again and I want you to wait till
3rd class so that's why we see like where to save your Bitcoins you know where to have what problem happens when you have it in exchange you look at that in the third module ok BTC it is a small string know there is a lot of algorithm will have to mention the you make feel like this is a small number which you can easily computer ok you can in some Google search would say like know if this key
just be broken it will take 25 years and recently might have seen a message or in a news in NDTV that you know and I phone was locked based on this public private key ok kid has logged out and looks like it is going to take 25 years to unlock that ok ok I am going to take a pass OK will look at some concept and then I'll get back to questions okay so Bitcoin wallet tips there are multiple war
like software wallets with bullets cold each wallet right what is the best wallet what is the recommended wallet we will see we will see it again in the third model just to give a glimpse of it they've given the SlideShare ok only for wallet we have a separate section ok so I don't want to discuss by the
ok so sending a transaction ok so what happens when you send the transaction how it is happening ok so this is nothing but say like what we have seen here right simple example whatever have given you this is enough so I list is sending 5 Bitcoins to Bob so it means Alice is digitally signing that ok she opens this should be in your account right it should be in
accounts should have for your 6 Bitcoins to transfer Bitcoins right so sorry sis sending to Bob so Alice is what she is not take 5 Bitcoins from me and then she is acknowledging using her privately because you can move funds from your wallet only if you are digitally signing it ok so others in the previous example have given otherwise anybody can steal your friends correct so only you are having your private key so what do you do
you log into your wallet you send 5 bit coins and using your private key so that becomes a digitally your digitally signing that yes my I want to transfer my Bitcoins to Bob ok so this becomes a transaction is a very important thing any questions
ok so questions for private key start on the network today's no it is not shared on the network your signing it that's it ok you are having the private key so question from JSON without private key she cannot register a transaction that's right she cannot register transaction where is write JSON so basically what you are trying to do this if you want
send anything in the network you should have your private key so that is what we're discussing till now ok the next CEO wants the transaction is created what happens its distributed in the network ok so for that in our previous example right so I showed you the notes similar like that once the Bitcoin she is sending Bitcoin to someone what happens is digitally after digitally signing it propagates to bbsr
RCM input goes on and interest since it is provided in this fashion it is very fast ok make sense question from it is the only thing I am doing a signing and my pair of public and private keys not a network it is not a network it is in your wallet
ok so it is in your wallet so no one has to validate so basically if you see if a is sending Bitcoins to be ok all if a is digitally signed only then that is that amount will go out of his wallet but that's about it so need to
there is a question from network how the network validates so that we know in the next two three flights will see like how this network is going to validate whether I have right amount of Bitcoins are absent we will look at the look at that Mohit ok so this is how it gets distributed in the network to the next one who wear it it's a transaction so that that's your question that we look at that ok so now you can ask me like ok so if it is a bank bank will know that whether I have this funds
in my account whether I am the right person to transfer the funds all this Bank knows here there is no Central authority who is going to validate this ok so here comes there are some snowed special notes in the network called - ok so they are going to validate all those transactions which are happening inside blockchain and they will only form something called block ok so they have this responsibility of creating a block
but again you can ask me so now you see bank validates now the minor there is someone call my name who can validate OK where did this message this becomes centralise authority no it is not sent laser therapy because if tomorrow if you want to participate in the validation you know no one is stopping you you set up your network you can become a minor and start validating the transactions ok make sense and it is open
so question from 10 since we don't know how many notes the distributor network want that time to complete the transaction because now what happens is normally every if you look at Bitcoin A block is formed every 10 minutes once ok anything but it's different ok so it doesn't matter okay the transaction skits propagated suppose ok suppose in an hour
supersu app send a transaction and that was not captured in that particular Baaghi he will get it in the next to block ok you can see online that where is your transaction whether this transaction was accepted in a block everything is open ok you can see that so there is to answer your question crisply maybe not immediate suppose you know and I was expecting in the mean on 9th
unit Amanora 9 o'clock maybe it is a transaction has been captured 9:10 or 9:15 ok missions ok so other questions will I get paid as a minor yes Jason you will be getting paid that are incentives will get into that can you Mallika can you explain more about - our next topic is completely - will go going to that
how - verify transaction yeah that is what we're going to spend another next new solid time over there any about digital signature Dharani digital signature just hold on Ok probly at the end of the class we can have a one on one ok like a problem can discuss I cannot meet you so that we can discuss with him finished up ok no Denise there won't be any topics on ICU
it is more often a blockchain OK so minus minus or validators right so basically there should be someone in the network who validates whatever transaction have done is right or wrong someone has to validate OK so the special entities are called - ok so they validate the validate and make sure that yes you have me know if you have send the transaction ok so like that
Diwali date ok so this is the this is the role of a minor basically there validating the transactions once a group of transaction is validated it is formed as a block and then add to the blockchain ok so 9 o'clock they had a block then they start validating the next set of transactions then they are the another block and there is no question about integrity of the previous block ok because once a block mind and it is their unboxing means that
is the right block ok no question about that ok we will see like how it is ok so what is the time now so probly will have a quick 5 minute break into now let's meet at 10 7
is it fine will have a 5 minute break ok
I am preparing some notes ok so don't worry that I am teaching a something I can get in 7 minute
ok guess back so fine
so now we are going to see like you know I will take an example and see this example previously what we have seen as it is a minor who does all the validation ok now we will see like what is happening behind the scenes and terminating your question also will be answered here OK so the public private key how old is digitally signing ok now we have 2 participants James has 10 Bitcoins and there is given OK so the idea is scenario like James
wants to send 5 Bitcoins to Kevin OK so how you can send he should know like what is the address of Kevin ok so 20 X ABC you be sending the funds ok but but James Dino James has to unlock his account and take 5 Bitcoins out of it right so I cannot simply take funds like I know just as simple as your bank account ok if you want to send some funds from your bank account you need your account username and password to send phone funds
so here what what is happening is ok so James is taking out 5 BTC from his account ok using his private key in basically the password is unlocking using his password and then sending funds to Kevin ok now this is nothing but digitally signing OK what what is digitally signed is ok that is I am a James here it is digitally signing using his private key saying that
I have sent games of send 5 Bitcoins to Kevin okay so anybody in the world who has gems public key can verify whether this is right or not ok so Jane Se signed using this transaction as using is private right so we know James public key what is this account that was then we can verify yes only James can send this transaction because it is
using his private key encryption basically encryption decryption so I can verify you give my little bit you can get confused ok for that I'll give you a negative so that it will be easy to understand latest se Chali is sending a transaction to cave in saying that you know some is missing that James thing ok so he is sending some transaction so
listen to digitally sign something so in this case you know if you know James it is taken out from James account if you use gems public key it will throw an error ok because only James can sign using is private key until unless James is sharing his private key to Charlie that's a different scenario ok otherwise this is not possible at all does it make sense so that is
what is being mentioned here Computer Graphics you see James sending Kevin 5vdc there are if you locate James wallet it is always comes with a pair of keys private and public key James is digitally signing it how he is using his private key and this transaction gets broadcasted ok so whether this transaction digitally signed whether it is right or wrong it is validated using gems public okay suppose we are giving 40 public is this will fail you cannot decrypted
ok does it make sense so again so question from eclipse say I am James I generate public key and private key pair and this question from Mohit ok letters a and James I generate a public and private key pair and ask a friend to transfer
BTC to my public key ok one she did that I transferred that amount to Alice ok you got your amount and your sending it now my generated key pair is on my local machine also very big question problem with what I would do is I can only YouTube ok so let's find out one and I am not trying can you tell
what is extra question Mohit Sunil so my question is I have when I generate public key and private key it is generated on my location right so how does the network gets to know my public ki duae broadcast my public is my question your network only if generating that public and private key to you so then net is connected on the network I cannot generate
public and private key you cannot ok ok fine but this is the basic thing ok so now we'll 12 more every question
everyone has access to public key address right yes so public is not on the local machine know it is so it is on blockchain if you want right suppose if you look at here this is a blockchain that info ok let us find a block here so you see all the public keys are visible here if you want to know this is the public period you can know like how much he wants I am clicking on this publicly you can see you know this public has no balance latest click this public
and see what's the valency s.s. 1.8 week I don't know who it is ok this publicly belongs to we don't know that but your network knows all the public keys okay make sense ya public key helps public key is reference you have an account number as a public key and
also in a private keys for signing the transactions ok and another thing what I want to tell his right so we are in the 35th flight today ok so do not worry these are the inner core class actually basically you are trying to understand what is bitcoin what is public key this will help you a lot and I'm in upcoming classes so it doesn't matter if it takes some extra time do not think that you know we are you now I am going to rush up and finish all those do not worry we will not take time understand
consumption only then move on only thing what I want you from you guys in case right if you'd little bit behind probly we can in I'm not in today's class or you know tomorrow or next week in a week and just extend by half an hour or so you can I don't want to ration when the concepts ok fine ok so this is about it so I hear what happens like in a distributed ledger OK what
happening behind the scenes were going to see so just imagine that these all three or four different nodes ok so james's machine cabinet machine Pollen robot which one is a machine ok so now I'm sending 5 Bitcoins what happens is shit is not going centralised so instead everyone has a copy of what happened ok so this transaction tried so 5 Bitcoins here it is sent to hear an hour then can can send to Kevin all those whatever
section has happened table in the network everyone has a copy of it ok so that is blockchain so you'll have it in the form of block you not have it in the form of transaction so this transaction would be grouped together in a block and you would be having that lock in a machine myself so next one so this a question also like denny's I think you had this question
show all the question was about ordering of transactions so if you transfer from normal if you transfer from your bank account to another bank account so you does it doesn't matter right for you like for example what happens immediately your account balance will be deducted and then you send out the funds suppose ok let's give me an example
supposed am since 5 Bitcoins to james's 10 becomes okay 10 BTC in 5 Bitcoins to Alice ok and James sending to more Bitcoins to to Bitcoins to say Chali ok so in this case in the ordering of transactions right so
you sometimes it may not be sure like which sensation you suppose you immediately my two transactions ok you send 5 bit kanche list immediately send to become Chali then what happens if you might see that first this transaction has gone through OK then the other transactions that means that first and section got confirmed UK this one got confirmed then the next one ok this is confirmed on this is confirmed to so it doesn't matter okay doesn't matter
ultimately your network will confirm all your transactions ok so we'll see like how this transaction works and so now so this is Deep dive into mining but for that you know how chronic chronologically how does order we can see
so don't get too much into details again how these are linked ok and this linking is a chapter ok how this block selling the city chapter will going to that but for now what I want you to understand this you see blocked 145 146 147 ok so look at this one this one is very important ok this block it right it has something called 8jj 4 or something ok
this block ID is linked here ok and this block id I hope you can see my mouse pointer F5 JJ this is link this is linked to your so that is so it is all chain lock after block right so this block hash or another sprocket is nothing but block has these all will be linked one after the another look like a linked list somewhere only we know what is linked list write each of these are linked
using this block hash ok that is nothing but you are enough I can a real time I can show you like how it is so if you look at here latest look at it so if I am going to look at block five 12828 ok if you look at 5 12828 block is nothing but it is
having some ID called this one hash right so the previous blockers this 15 12827 828 from here from latest go to previous block A2 it should be 8 to 6 ok so that is that is all linked make sense ok now so this wood is linked
next what I wanted to do is fine so before that I will take some remind me how unblock is formed and then let's go into these details ok
ok so I am already prepared some notes ok so we can use this ok instead of me writing it and how things ok basically what we are going to see now is it is a very important concept OK it is like how mining works OK what is the role of a minor what he is doing so that is what we will say for the next 15 to
Manasvi look at that ok so some minor basically nothing but they are going to validate all the transactions for the given period of time and they will put together into a block they will frame a block validate the transaction at this into a block ok and then added to the blockchain so that is how they you know that is so it is done ok so now you can ask me ok what is that they're trying to solve ok
penis enter transaction it is from this public key that is all fine but what is the day 2 extra ok so that we will see here now ok ok first look at this portion already seen when she like in a piece of Bob analyst similarities in soil becomes to Charlie basically what does a couple of things which happens you will have to Tom has to prove that yes Bitcoins
he has 5 Bitcoins so far that he needs is private key so in this case Tom says 5 Bitcoins to charge Nokia so Tom says he wants how we receive them because we can claim that is because using is privately any questions still here ok so I see Mason oh ok and then a transaction gets propagator
hi transaction gets propagated from peer-to-peer some basic steps are done and then it gets propagated ok each node will do basic check okay is basic shiksha then and then it will get a proper Gate then what will happen is now minor now it is mine is Roadies he's not write a basic notes let's take them know they are VLC one I'll call want
ok so 1234 at the four Knights EP 107 lot of notice so transaction get sent and it's get propagated but is in it is not formed in a block it ok only transactions are get proper transactions are getting propagated it is not confirmed okay so transactions are propagated what - is ok he is used to validate OK what minor does
he will group some set of unconfirmed transactions that is what is unconfirmed transactions is nothing but she is there a lot of dragons I am using please let me know if anything if your stuck up let me know ok so a transaction there are two things one is confirmed and other one is unconfirmed OK when it is can
found meaning that it will be in some block OK it is unblock 400 it means that the transaction is confirmed for example if you look at here will take you there are lot of blocks Nokia so if you take this block inside block there are transactions it means that this block is confirmed okay this whatever trance
section Singh said this blog is confirmed make sense so do hazaar confirm transaction if the transactions is not you don't sit inside a block it means that it is not confirmed it ok so what minor does is he groups all this unconfirmed transactions let's say that transaction tx1 TX to get ltx thousand ok it takes all these transactions
groups them together ok and basic checks like whether it is from this public key and basic shiksha done ok and then ask my dad he has to run a puzzle ok to validate ok so I will tell you what the specialist
and then let's Stay That Way We Are solving this person ok ok the puzzle we're trying to our something a thing with someone as me ok this puzzle which we are trying to solve is called proof of work ok so this is the puzzle with a minor is trying to solve OK what is this puzzle see that
ok so if you look it again I am taking it to blockchain dot info ok so if you look at blockchain that info it will tell you the difficulty rate ok see you see that the difficulty rate is like 3 bilion write three Billy and something ok so there is some difficulty rate and you can see something called hash ok
so you will say so this this transactions right all this transaction will be grouped together ok and then headed would be formed header is nothing but it will have lot of values wait a minute let me ok so these are some of the headaches ok we give
ok so basically what we are doing yes I am just copy and paste on 2nd so we have a no blockchain headed has contains desalination previous blockhead previous header ok
block ok so for that what it do son first there is something like when you send a transactions block a block will contain a header ok so this will have some version and all the stuff we are not worried about it right now ok so ultimately OK what we are trying to validate is let me we saw something called difficulty factor ok
your network will tell if we use this so I don't want write again
but you just let's finish this ok so we are going to puzzle you know so here what happens here is network will generate you something called a challenge doing so that is an nothing but a number let's say that it is a challenge string is zero at some random number ok and it will tell you a difficulty rate ok now it is 3 p.m. right 3 p.m. so this difficulty rate
nothing but the number of zeros in front or I'll come to that ok so this is the challenging have got - got the challenge tree how this challenge Singh is formed is based on all these transactions and everything he gets a challenge to know what he'll have to do mine has to do if he takes his talent string and he in ads different combination of numbers ok for example
this is the challenging OK then what he does is he checks number to ok and this will produce result ok plus Now means when I said plus we are going to Hash of it ok you do A Plus 1 and 2 hash ok you do plus 2 and 2 hash plus 3/4 and it goes on ok and I will repeat again so do not worry so and you take a hash
take a hash hash so basically you are given a challenge string and what your has to prove is this is your challenge string when you add any number you know you will have to find this number when you add this number and you do has what I want is you should get a number with the prefix of 42 zeros ok or after sometime the difficulty maybe 4301
doesn't matter OK so the difficulty factor will you tell I tell you like how many zeros you would like a minor has to find out and there is no right direct way to go and find the zeros OK it is only it can only happen using I mean when using permutation and communication and combination you'll have to try out different numbers and then find out this 4303 caretel here any course
take a fear and once again I reiterate any questions will ask who appoints the minor right so Vilas anybody can participate as minor suppose if you think you know you would you want to be part of mining community yes if you have you left all you have to do is set up those powerful machines and you can start me
what is meant by doing hash is it calculate EMI in 43 zeros is what is 43 constant for all transactions I'm taking what I did not understand why do we have proof of why this trip so ok fine I have taken your
distance and let me go through and I'll try to answer all the questions ok fine so basically if you have a transaction ok transaction based evaluation like weather Tom has really has 5 Bitcoins those transactions are validated ok but ultimately we are going to follow the block block block after block we are going to refer forever it's not going to be there since you have send a transaction from public ok
sweet we are building Sambhal we are building a transaction leisurewear building a history right so we are grouping them all of them into a blocks okay so someone has to consolidate weather Thomas in 5 Bitcoin to Charlie whether it is really true if you really true you know he is signing up that's why get confirmation is done and that is being framed as a block ok so that the transaction goes through so that is the whole idea of it another question I got it
why this proof of earn that is the proper protocol right when this Bitcoin was developed this was the protocol which you know as part of it why does required I tell you as part of Maya ok suppose if you are if keep in mind this ok and you confirm all these transactions are right and then you make a block you get the reward of 12.5 Bitcoins in today's news of today you get 12.5 Bitcoins so it's around $10,000 so
how much you get you get a lot of money so that's why people want to mine and make sure that the transactions are valid ok so there is incentive there is incident from my nap so that's why people want to mine and confirm the transactions ok now I will go back so these are other unconfirmed transactions ok and let's go to the parcel ok so we are getting a challenge string ok this challenge thing is
tutored from the header so whatever we have write the Protocol in the your Bitcoin software calculates dispersal string for you the network network will give you what difficulties factor ok that difficulty factor I think Jason ask me like that that is 4300 4200 that is constant OK so the network will find out how many transactions are happening currently ok how is my bandwidth of the network ok base
that this difficulty factor will be automatically adjust it ok if the difficulty factor is nearly hundred it means that you need to find only 20 ok but as and when the network grows the difficulty factor will become will increase the reason being Bitcoins value so high right now it is $10,000 close to $10,000 everyone wants that reward ok so that more people get into mining the difficulty rate increase this
Mandakini know that some things work ok make sense I will show you some oldest block and I'll show you what is the difficulty factor then and now ok so now let's go here blockchain dot info and I am going to add 100 minute so we can search the block ok I am searching 102 block ok
find 8000 ok let me look at hundred the block ok you look at the difficulty ok way back it was only one ok right now we are in 3 bilion ok so that serve it was more and more the network goes more and more the difficulty factor comes into picture and so this number of zeros at this difficult period would be very high so today I would be 4300 network automatically talk later no network will tell you like
what is the difficulty factor you'll have to solve ok today's 43 zeros in fact like to 3 classes before it was less then I started with an ID like the difficulty factor was less now it is more you know it's going to momos going to get difficult ok and you might feel like ok only for a day 30 second find know when we said 42 zeros it is 2 power 42 so you will have to perform enormous amount of
calculations to find the right number ok so when I say enormous amount of calculations its trillions of calculations per second you have to do and then find the right answer ok this amount of zeros OK then you can ask me like ok I am going to plug in my computer and then I am going to start my OK what will happen is the computers or what we have today it mean to find this number of 42 zeros
normal computer it may take mm is ok with a normal competition power what we have ok it will take several years to find the right number ok so you'll have to invest very high enough with Complex chips and there something called mining rigs will have to invest more so that you can perform some calculations per second okay and for a minor since he has invested more and he is trying to also validate the
yes you know how he has got this incentive reward doesn't make sense did I answer all your questions ok now Jason I hope I answered your question of 43 constant it is not constant it will change question from Mallika can you explain how the zeros of pain
it is based on difficulty level you know the network through the new the difficulty factor every time question from Savita what is meant by doing a hash it is calculated UK has nothing you know if you are she's nothing but so if you have some ABC right if you do a hash has suffered it will generate a number ok chalega 14 digit number of 20 digit number for everything and it will
be unique for each input ok each input will have a different hash so the protocol says you add this number and do a hash that result should have this many zeros ok make sense and also what I want you to go through Savita you just look at the black ones okay mentioned what is hash you know how it is different spend some time on that ok
Sudeep why we have this profile for because if if we don't have this proof of work ok then block would be formed immediately ok and other thing is what about the incentive who made who are you going to give the incentives ok that's a very good question I will answer you just give me some time when does a blocked nose it will end UK means I will put again
two different way minor will know moment he finds the so many zeros in OS that this has been successfully mind then question from Savitha is it possible that two different - will pick up few transactions to mine that is possible that is our next topic we are going to see Savita question from Sudheer is there a logic for minors to pick unconfirmed transactions yes there is a way you could find out in a full not in use
why not you have the privilege of finding out what are those unconfirmed transactions source second question can multiple - have same unconfirmed transactions yes there can be multiple minus okay in that topic I am not there at first I want you to understand this puzzle alone then we will see like you know what if two person is trying to find the same thing will find out that ok so there is a possibility
that both my name generator same block at the same time yeah I will come to that question will the minor come to know how many zeros needs to be gender based on yes you will come to know what is knowns OK I will how will the minor come up with 123 nonsense nothing but the answer ok so we are here right the 123456 whatever we are trying to substitute correct this is nothing but the norms
make sense how will minor come up with 12345 before hashing so what happens is when you install a Bitcoin mining software OK your machine it will take care of all the permutation and combination all what to substitute how to hack how to compare to that will take care of it okay me be physically not go and substitute this number
software would take care of it so question from Mohit can minor just pick and choose transaction and meet the has Complex complexity requirement know that is not possible ok she still minor can pick and choose transactions but it doesn't matter we have something call erase I will tell you that Supreme I think I know what I'm going to do it I am going to take another 10 minutes so come after that can be
can you take care of me know BM insulation I don't know she's ok so question from Mohit what do you mean by network generator challenge string is it generated and broadcasted is this done with statistical simulation
MI note sheet the verification process by on computer ok so many questions right so what I will take on my own ok first first I'll start within 1 months questions that's important question OK so the question is who computes this challenge free ok that question so this challenge thing is computed with whatever you have you have this trance
in your hand ok and you have decided version actually it is nothing but short 256 this is nothing but a hash ok hashing algorithm ok so so so this is nothing but short 256
Tamasha 256 is hashing algorithm ok like we have md5 lot of things we have Shastri lot of algorithms that you can the challenge string is found like this you'll have to 2 times sha 256 of your header OK Here The catchers this header also include something called nonce OK so the idea is you substitute ok
1 2 3 4 5 4th and make sure that you get the right number of CS ok so this is both challenge and answer a couple together ok so you do a short 256 header information you have all the previous edible root on all the stuff ok plus some number you had then you should get meet up with the difficulty number of zeros this one is it clear for everybody
ok so what will do it next 15 months right let's not jump to any other topics I'll just finished of this and tomorrow right so up in any problem in anomaly what I do is I take half an hour more heavy every class in like a question hour at end of the class for some reason I have some
stop at 11 ok so what I can do is I can come half an hour before that is our class starts at 8 o'clock right I can come to join by 7:30 so I'll take up some questions every man this is going forth know if you have any questions just join before half an hour we can have a one on one so right now I will just in about tomorrow's class since we are in ldap with lot of topics I want you to place to join before half an hour
let me take up only questions and I am going to Unmute like who has questions please do feel free I am going to Unmute and let's discuss and finish it off Ok awesome let me know if you are 9 case just ping me like regarding BM insulation ok let me finish up with this questions and then you can take up ok first time going to Unmute Mohit Jago it Mohit
good question I have is lets see I am a minor node and I've got a r i got some transactions it because network what causes a transaction so am I temporarily stowing those transactions before donating A block that is my first ok first question if you are a mining note ok so if you are a minor you have something called a memory pool ok by default when you install will Bitcoin software what happens if you have something called memory
where you will collect all the unconfirmed transactions now wondering LOL these unconfirmed transactions and I'm only responsible for generating the header generating the version and getting the previous headed out of the previous block that my sweet basically I am doing work in isolation I got this memory unconfirmed transaction in the memory tool and then I generate the header and all these are specified by the
software version that I am gonna get over it and you said the challenge thing is basically so I understand the concept of the damned trying to generate the hash using all then come confirm transaction plus the previous years has it is supposed to meet with the complexity requirement of because since hash is unpredictable it is supposed to meet this compressor to Coimbatore start with 5 zeros of 4202 right now something that what this is the Challenger
is he saying the challenge string is the string that I am trying to generate hash out of the challenge string as you see here so the challenge string is nothing but the actual algorithm if you see it is short 256 of header who is framing the setup your framing the header ok so you know what version you are running OK you know what is the previous block Nokia previous blog as a minor you should know that you know what was the previous confirmed block you know that and
you know you are going to generate the time ok so all these details you have ok apart from this detail you also add something this permutation combination write you add that to Hash and see whether your result has 42 zeros is not good next substitute with number to do has find out whether there were 42 zeros and it
what is the challenge doing I got this part but what is the challenging when you are saying so basically I'm just guessing I am just calculating and no answer right so the other part of it right so other part of these pills computes the challenge streak wrestling challenge staying at the data that has to be hatched ok all this other information thank you
that's on you thank you thank you so please others in a let me know who wants to go next Shailendra should I am YouTube
I know sometimes what happens is I know people raise hands I won't be knowing who has raised so how can I know like and yes ok BSNL
800 real real example from the existing account and confirm the transaction will take in the block and then create a header real and what is article what you do is it is a very time consuming process but I will what I would do it I will refer you to an article ok so that they were really computer taken an example and computed and don't like to know what is the result in your questions thank you
ok ok I am good and you to give me a minute looks like Anand Anand Anand
hello hello I was trying to meet you
where is sarpa mentioning again he is going to take a presentation rights ok so and he will he he will let you know you can another 5 minutes so other others like ok fine I want to problem YouTube questions
Agra my question is can anyone best featured the entire verification process what happens is once the in a once this block is verified ok it has to be attested by other - also ok at the time in November and also he has spent a significant amount of work
no competition power electricity and everything is paint and has found the puzzle right normally it is highly impossible mission 99.99% is highly impossible to find the right number immediately OK so if at all if someone is faking it and sending that you know I found out other - will find out whether this person has really solve the puzzle ok and display find that you know this minor has lied or he hasn't done is job then that
Gopi rejected make sense so it is not possible any other questions for on any other questions no no that's fine ok fine so let me then now let's think we'll go that
looks like Mallika for some reason I am not able to meet you ok ok so there's any any questions
I don't see any questions sorry good so questions from Mohit how how does the network know that my wallet has a boy balance right network knows every balance in at work ok it knows your public key it was like what balance it has got only thing I did it is not tied up to anything but it knows everything
auditions question from JSON like after finding zeros how it's from why do you have to do short to 15 students so that the product of demands in a that it is coded there is no specific reason for phone kaun what is what's the basic development knowledge required to be able to develop all these so these are the concepts ok so we will not develop all this so basically you know if you look at blockchain world you should have good
collage on either golang when you look at Atrium you need to have solidity there is a programming codes already tea and with JavaScript JavaScript is a must actually Shailendra short 56 + months we create 40 20 that's right when I make a transaction doesn't make sure my wallet has the balance
yes otherwise you will not be able to sign at all know it suppose you don't have a balance you cannot send transaction even if you send a transaction you try to fake your PR will reject your transaction so where is the balance to balance stored in the blockchain OK it is all inside the block make sense it has all the records
yeah so before that you know let me go to with Sudhir there is a question which one major complaint about Bitcoin is the transaction is slow or not real time can this be addressed by reducing complexity Sudheer let me and I think you had other questions also let me and meet you for some Jago it Sudhir yeah my question was around I got the part of why
meaning is the importance of minors but in terms of complexity what are not understanding is in terms of proof of work and that be changed so that the transactions are faster and if so why why why isn't that being done ok so if you look at it Hariom rate today is Aryan is trying to use something for proof of stake ok a proof of stake so that is going to be
much faster than what Bitcoin has ok and when you look at Bitcoin so it is open community which has this proof of work algorithm already developed OK what they are trying to do is there something called lightning network ok so they are working on something ok to make these transactions for first year they'll be proof of work but on top of it there are some information which can get validated later or something ok so they are working on a solution
make it faster but as you mentioned yes it is slow ok and why they introduced this proof of work is because one has to compute to get those Bitcoins okay does not like anybody comes by in San get the bitter because Bitcoin has lot of value so you know it was meant that you make so much effort to get this Bitcoin and how long does approximately take to my nerve block if you have a normal
cover it will take 10 minutes mention if you have a normal computer it will take 2000 years or maybe you find you something like that very thanks you thank you ok so now welcome to Karachi also had some questions about you won't see once you are you clear about the concept Subhash I didn't get any questions from you Subhash I hope you understood
Sudhanshu hikvision software from software in computer
zeros will it be like considered as confirmed transactions and how it goes to A block and forms is a confirmed that is going to be your next topic ok for now we found the parcel ok so then comes the next topic like how these is it valid ID informed as a block that will be the next class or any other questions and then thank you thank you shouldn't
two apart from BTC any other business process like logistics is it useful maybe there looking at logistics supply chain Pharma there trying to couple with this iot devices there are many areas but it's all in the discussion in the preliminary stage know in a cylindrical provide software computer no and these are very complex software
complete some problem I'll have to find this only the concepts ok ok so now I'm going back so let me know like Kaise ping me like if you want if I should Unmute you let me know so Dani is the week are in a Pratik Sandeep let me know so looks like Mohit won't answer his name
what I'm not able to understand is like another the blockchain started hey I receive some money some BTC from a different wallet at a public kiss and a money to this public key my and I've got custody transaction on to the network he transfer list to this public key now I can put it in my transaction is in let's say 10 blocks Spa in past and somebody else other people have done
actions and not this new transaction that I am trying to got cast is coming on to the 12th block now at that point of time will the minor actually go back and look at my you know the transaction that happened 10 block in past to figure out that he by Mohit receive this 10 BTC form this different public address right would that happen
happens but in a different way what I want you to do is probly what I'm going to do is need a YouTube video ok Sir ok Sir I will point out that it need some time and understanding ok so first go through that ok so when I am sending it to everyone so I can take a look
so this is where it you can go to send to everyone so movie then team like you just spend some time if possible ok so you will come to know so its me now it is some time to explain so that's why I'm giving that still you have some doubts let me know ok I am sending to subscribe

to give me a response so I can go for the
yeah Dennis Dennis your brazzer hand yeah actually muted yourself can you please Unmute uterus
yeah Mohit hey Shubham I'm done with setting up the VM box on button should have already done all of that I already logged into the VM asked the virtual appliance is there anything else you will be doing in the session I can I was actually I was going to connect so you can
how to connect but if it's ok then I can send you a
yeah so have you guys downloaded it is it computer if its curved downloaded make sure you install it
extra dollar rate is actually quite a bit closer to 6.7 GB so take some time to download please tell me if you got the link or not
please raise hands if you have any question
yeah cylindrical and updated
can I have anything else
ok now support system is up and running I'm in this virtual machine then after that what I have to do ok after that you have to access step process is actually loves everybody will can you get confused to tell you have to meet up to to go get to his own path so far up to now go to the readme txt and what about commands are in their mystery update your VM have done in redmi text only we have we command so that the fibre
there is no need if if you wait so I can actually even this situation computer I can actually tell everyone how to connect with the difference but contract download will take some time it is 6.7 GB
all
yeah Jason Yadav Jason you have raised the hell hello hello
see the step how it is it is actually being done ok
yelavi car
call the virtualbox so when you are trying to install the error coming in string in the battery rate
yeah cylinder film so you
right now you don't have to go download the application fabric composer so just wake up to now so as you have finished already told you to I can have given you another testrpc to run command have you got that
ok the instruction that you that just do that yes he Shubham so I am not able to see those instructions that you're talking about running Dal PC
send it on WhatsApp
yeah sorry we actually will this installation package included in the recorded videos because mine is too slow and it is showing 15 hours level
I cannot come on it shows me a list of private keys and listening on port number low close 8545 that girl it is good so can you tell me which folder I need to go now
you don't have to go into any folder just exist in the home
I am going to move forward as as you can at least see actual how does how does done so after you have downloaded it the virtualbox so you can know how actually you're going to install it after you are downloaded the world the VM just open the Oracle VM virtualbox first click on the file then click on import appliances
click on this folder then go to your VM image file where you have saved then click on Erica VM it it will be a ovf file or open Virtual ization format click on open then next after that you will see and appliance settings make sure the address is C drive
if you don't have space in C drive put it on the truck but I would recommend to have some space free in the secret so you can put everything so after that the space import it will start start loading the VM so I have already loaded it in my system server cancel it make sure it comes to hundred percent is it is going to take like 10 to 20 minutes depending upon your system performance
so so is there anything any doubt you have up to now
should I continue or do you want me to wait ok so if anybody has any
can you please restart the whole detail see what is a failed to import appliance see underwater underscore p.m. could not create port medium user underscore slash Farhan virtualbox VM the next line is oblique blockchain edureka the exact period thank you
this 001.com DK within bracket b e r r underscore underscore error tell me ok your screen so I am doing in
because she is in which I am basically connected is not there I don't have the admin permission so I am being in my machine so I can send you the link for a screenshot possible what I will log into that you can continue I will hear and then I will connect you ok
ok just hold on a second
ok yes Shailendra Chauhan trying to say
ok I think it might be there is less the space would be one of the reasons but I have to understand there it was so yes see if you
your browser downloading so don't worry just stay on the video to see action how it is done I can and this the sessions are recorded so you can watch it later so I'm going to go to step by step so I can view it not a problem will that be ok phone
ok should I continue ok Savita is saying yes so after you are imported
place on the blockchain edureka that should be starting to click on the start and it will load up the PM
so as you can see that there is no loading pages come the password is edureka
ceoup know anybody have any doubt or they are missing some common then not able to run the PM accept you if you are not able to download the person that's a hotel I guess so when your VM is loaded the first Singh
what to do to make sure go to the readme txt and execute the first two commands that that is so CPT get update and Sudo apt-get upgrade after this to don't and others like golang I have been all install and configure there are multiple softwares in this VM have been pre installed so what you have to do is to run the command without
Restoration process so the first thing is make sure you execute this to command on the terminal after you have exams ok
so after you open up the terminal make sure you run the test RTC just after CSS but this will do is actually create a listening port at 8545 this actually gives you the private keys and Elsa level account number through which we can actually run the Selenium program because when urine is sorry to smart contract it actually consumes it
ok well skin Motors used in hell yes Mohit Mohit Mohit I am sorry I am you can you please share this text documents I will share the documents just make sure you Raise ticket through edureka support@uber.com schedule
show me some new pics so any doubt
running on 8545 and we have to make sure this get connected to the equality before that we have also have to connect it with the ethereum block Explorer so again open a new terminal don't close is down in this go to see the Explorer after going into Explorer write down npm start
I'm serious trying to it is installing after that it
photo studio near
I have saved you in recovery I'm ok now click on open
this is not showing anywhere
yes but I have saved in a folder blockchain but it is not showing as well
so this is a visual view so it would be much easier for you to process as you installing the Mac yeah we can tell me your way up to where you have progressed act
I couldn't able to find my VM @ VM can you send me the document
what you up to tonight ok so we have already to put open as you can see this port is for 88000 which will connect with the Atrium block Explorer with this sport 8545 will connect with the remix solidity so
open the Google Chrome after opening the Google Chrome on the remedy if you don't have the tab in here just go into the Google and write down remix different
so you will be able to visit inside so and make sure you opened it from browser in the next as you can see it is running on localhost 8000 sexually show you the block number which has been currently their Surgicals There's A block is zero size mm stand is this this is in Linux format and services
the current CEO currently the 20 and the block is real reason because we haven't created one and when you are going to deploy a contract using remix then block would be created currently when you were you open the remix the different page you will see this program contract but it is by default but we are not going to rain today any kind of call recorder pro and contract going to show you just how to setup the environment
receptors that make sure you click on the Run after clicking on the run click on the environment variable and change into the victory provider it will ask you are you won't connect to the eternal note press I'm ok then you can see the same address that we are created in we have generated this report that in our system that is fake
listing on local is it 5:45. Ok now you will see this kind of message that it is not possible to connect and try to connect Wi-Fi and it CrPC ok you can see there should be a another another file which has came to your at your address bar click on that and make sure you load unsafe script after you have loaded the answer
refresh the page in refresh after paying guest refresh you can see it is in the with the provider and and again select the environmental and activity provider so after that you will see you will get the same at home
that is currently present in the command prompt annual see the same account in here so when you will provide not click on ok ok now you can see we got multiple accounts which have actually one if the value from now you can select any other account and actually can deploy smartphone
it will consume from here after if anybody has any doubt please tell me because this is because this is everything we are going to install for now now your environment has been set up and you are right to work on blockchain advisor for different has no setup your BMS system and does recording session has been Africa

pronunciation by 32 proposal names and Pathology program that you are saying that is how can I see who is created or destroyed application is created that's ok so I don't have to do anything you can do it but you don't have
SOL is running it is a default program that is in session there to give you an example of give you a test of holiday
ok ok not a problem you can increase from back and how it is
once you have to create contract that so that I will give you
and that's it that you are trying to code in the remix to make sure you put the server on otherwise it would connect
I have one more question whether we have to do program with sample data 16 another one if you cannot
yes No if so what I wanted to understand is a bit of technical details update so what I am what I understand is the fact that you're using the web Thi provider vijayshree connecting to my localhost over http and when I choose it for the first time it tried injecting the local host script and at runtime in idt them because home
so do you want to security settings and that's when the localhost port based JavaScript file got loaded and that's what is able to talk to you please and not all that we have to connect
safescrypt ok so basically just looking at my local blockchain
what contractor please start the block megan's because it is also mining free URL blocked to make sure that would be deploying like more than one Note 2 demo the distributed as well as it will be just want single node single my destiny
metamask the Inspector will give them and they are few other aspects in agricultural development
two different network so you basically saying that we might feel that the contract in Remix all detail for stress to download close 8545 and then deployed on one of the test networks of ethereum and then when everything looks okay we can required to the ethereum public network
Osho Shailendra address and I have 1 question we have started 218 545 18
multiple Twitter accounts in which we have Fake it so you can actually on the solitary contract and 8545 is actually connecting with the remix quality this browser does the content was pretty sure thing that you ask a question about I am sorry I am not understand when you run the test
object private accounts which contains Hindi content is equals and when we use the remix solidity and we have connected with 85454 as we have seen in the above popup come and we can connect with the localhost so happened that we have generated fake account will connect with and you can see this is the same account you can change your
ok this account be different
