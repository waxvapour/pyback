hello good morning think can you hear me now
ok good good fun good morning you know right now if you're very less number of participants I'm not sure which whether I should go ahead with the class but let me know if you have any questions feel we can take the questions
the next class you know at the start I will mention that because is going to start at 7:30 ok we can have been a little more right now let me know if you have any questions we can I can address and the class would get started at 8 o'clock there are very few participants like around 8 participants and we have wall we should have almost 20 or 22 participants ok
a question on VM VM I think I'll have to get in touch with the Surf I'm ok ok fine ok so anyway right anyway we will use the VM only from our 4th or 5th class ok so so nothing
and you can just send a support ticket sale in the where we need to write the code for smart contract we should write there are many tools available we can write using browser there is something called solidity compiler ok with it called remix we can write there are there is something like not tools like sublime
Visual Studio tools beginners that Shailendra we can use browser as well
online process you can include libraries but normally if you want to write a simple first in a year first world war what is it called If you want to write your first program you don't need to include libraries and write Asus
this program Shailendra Singh me a program so by default when you have installed right when you have installed your VM with default this program comes with that ok so Pragya is like in my fine so question from vamps
still I didn't install the Oracle VM you should know Oracle VM we will start using only from our 5th class ok or 6th class so pretty much the first four classes right it's all theory ok and the problem we will look at some of the installing some of the wall its ok and you know we'll get to know like what is the wallet where is the private key public he will get to know that but the real blockchain development been long
start from V class and then is what if I already have my wallet that's fine more minutes that's fine but you know for it doesn't matter if you want to create new 10 wallets not a problem in there is no limitation for understanding purpose will create new
yes I mean the Bitcoin wallet Shailendra so question I got a question on minor how do we know if there is a duplication when many minor there is a duplication when many minor viewing the same blockchain I will come to that what happens
please when you when you block when you mind block OK so the block if you see a carefully this blog is interlinked with the previous block ok and similar this this thing goes on the other new block will be reference to this block that is it all changed so there is no way that duplicate blocked enter
ok ok 3 then let's catch up at 8 o'clock ok looks like another 12 more participants has to join so probly in the next class I will inform other participants that we are going to start sharp at 7:30 ok
hey good morning team so yeah we have we have around 22% right now
ok good guess what I wanted to do was the next class right so next class when does it for next Saturday ok or ok so bye then please join before half an hour ok so today there were some participants like around we had 9 participants but I couldn't start the class I was just waiting for others to join so why you are doing this is because if you have any questions we can get clarified or
sometimes you are we might be going in a slow paced we can both account did that so that's why I'm asking you to join before half an hour ok Sobha Onyx class I am going to start another syllabus by you before half an hour please please do you join there is a question from Sri there is a time change for us people from next week on onwards give me a min
toilet me look at the timing know if you look at the entire class schedule right it's all at 8 A.M OK when you Look At Us it would be a different time but what I want you to do is joint before half an hour in whenever is your schedule time join before half an hour is ok for couple of classes ok at this for couple of classes once we
up to the speed then we can have regular schedule ok fine ok for us they mentioned in one scene machinery St so whatever it is right so whatever it is just before half an hour ok so I don't know what was IST time right now
ok if 9:30 EST then join at 9 o'clock that's right ok now let's
Jayshree what we have seen as we have looked at what is blockchain basically like the how these blocks are arranged and we spend some time on public and private private key then after that was in ABC what happens when you initiate transaction ok how does a transaction get digitally sign and then what happens behind the scenes you know we look that my
ok remaining we you know deep dive then looked into mining concepts how things are getting mind ok so what is the role of a minor so any any questions till that so question answering 9st would be 6:30 a.m. for you
don't worry about that you know whatever time is there half an hour before ok so you're ok ok so don't see any questions ok
so quick recap ok so quick recap is what we did a sweep in a we looked at how the transaction is getting initiated the public key and private key how you sign a transaction OK then we looked at 2 money ok so mining
mining the major thing here is so so so mining what we're trying to solve is we're trying to find a number which as prefix number of zeros ok so what number of zeros one number of zeros to determine define in it is defined by the hour network ok I did changes ok bye Sony home in an example Block 1 had a difficulty number one ok right now we are into 3. Some William
difficulty this going to change in over the period of time so that difficult is nothing but to the number of zeros which you need to find before ok so you have all the information so basically when you start mining you will get all the transactions ok so you will have to run full node ok so these details will see in third chapter but high level concept is you will have to group some of the unconfirmed transactions and confirm put that
block and verify that blocked ok so that is the motto of minor so you have all those details so you have these transactions and you can frame the header as a Myna Myna can frame the header what is a version what is the previous block saddle route will see in today's clerk class what is market route to with all these details here all these details + all this other details + what you will have to do
you should add this number ok nonsense the parcel number ok so what do you do with you at this nonsense Amber and upon adding this you have to find a relevant number of zeros whatever difficulty rate demands so that number of zeros has to be formed out ok so once you find that out yes you are one the person and important point to be noted is there is no direct way to find this number only by competition competition it could be found found ok
in this case if you look at number in start from number 1 in it goes on where it is so that is only way we could solve the puzzle this is a caption from JSON what is can you explain what is maca root in in second in today's class we will look at to make beetroot ok I am going to tell you what is market but not right
just hold on for a while ok so this is about it now Anand what is hash hash hash also we look today ok so I don't know if you had time to look at mine of the blog link which I post that have mentioned hash ok so so too so quickly what we
whst explain has because many many places will look at has she has is nothing but a one-way function hash is there is some algorithms which are written so if if you send any number or any string for that matter whatever it is whatever input it could be ok there is a input and you send it via a Hash Function so this has
mathematical formula for mathematical function so this will generate even output this is and this is always one way meaning from output you cannot find what is the input ok so for example if you give ABC the hash could be something like some some gibberish number ok so if you give BF it will be a totally different number
so this is this is us one ok so important English with this number 3S and if you cannot derive what is ABC that is no I'm way going back ok there are different types of hash functions like md5 ok and hash sha 256
Shastri sha 512 and it goes on like that in practical scenario where you can find this is so when you download a song or when you download something from Torrent or somewhere else Ok so finally what will happen is daily use empty for your something to compute the hash and they find out like whether the the downloaded content writer whatever you are downloaded is fully downloaded or not ok so for something like that they use switch off
Jason will hash generator always Unicode yes with 12V always unique so probly I'll send the link again Anand what are you doing I hope you have joined in WhatsApp group as well ok let me ping it in the WhatsApp group ok so now moving on Sunday
from yesterday is overall like in amp I spoke to the my management team and find a found out like you know where we need to improve in terms of feedback and learn how to help the students what I found was sometimes there is a lot of questions and we are losing focus on it ok so what I am going to do today is your problem I will take some 10 minutes or 15 min 10 minutes that we find 10 minutes I am going to explain the content OK then take up and then take a questions ok
is people feel like come in it's getting lost so here now the question comes like we are going to look at some some scenarios ok we have mind ok we have found the one man has found
other 11 number of zeros ok so now what happens next if the question ok so if you look at here in this example just assume Bitcoin is a not not just using me if you look at Bitcoin it is a like a vast spread network ok so you can buy Bitcoins in US you can go to Greenland and you can get Bitcoins its all connected via Network and I know its spread geographical ok and there is no there is no rest
that you know - has to be from China or minus has to be from India in there is no constraint like that anybody who has a computer and relevant amount of money power in a good computing power he can participate as a minor ok so now the question comes into mind that what happens when same to me or in on two different - is solving the same result ok so here either one for example -1 in India
solving the puzzle ok so some heroes and minor one say in submarine California solving the person ok so zeros now who's blocked would be chosen so that is that question comes into might ok even yesterday so many many of you asking the questions okay so far all these there are some rules which
which is done after mining OK so the first processes transaction right first this transaction you sender initiated transaction then transaction becomes transaction then it becomes block right then minor start smiling ok now your blog to get validated so this is important is ok so block ok 1 - is that I have to solve the puzzle and its
it is fine ok but to get to validate and an added to chain there are some rules to be followed ok only then it gets added to the chain sore these rules which are defined by the Bitcoin network or the core protocol network or call consensus ok consensus is nothing but coming to an agreement ok so sweet is a distributed at work right so that should be some rules like you know what if two people have mind the same
at the same time who will get the reward because these are you at home right so if you're mine A block you have spending lot too much of complete computation power and your earning those 12.5 Bitcoins so what a father person also same thing and then there could be a problem right between both are - so that is all solved by this consensus algorithm or consensus rules ok so there are many rules ok sorry not
get into Mini me know all of those rules important rules will see the number one you see first rule is if both have same to same let's take the same example okay California and India both have mind at the same time California and India Indian Myna ok some minor has made the same time so in this case what happens is first who's block was whose block size had more than
ok so this is a question then next one who who worked more to find the hash ok so that is like who put who has you know who has put in more effort in terms of computation power to solve the block ok next shift
is this true or equal ok there are several other parameters I am just touching meaning in the high level like what are the most important things if what is these both are same OK then what happens when you both have had enough number of transactions and then both had spent enough time on computation power then what happens then something called longest chain
I will come into this longest chain concept these are the three things which happens OK then these are the three main consensus rules ok now you can think of it like ok block size one had more transactions who won block okay suppose California my reminders of winner ok in this case what will happen is California minor ok or any minor for that matter what he should says he should
present ok he is proof of work proof of work answer ok so what is answer in the basic know what is the non Sai used to compute it ok so what will happen is this blog ok whatever the California - cleans to be the winner this blog is broadcasted ok so once broadcasted what happens The Other -
network right there could be like a Indian like there are many other - 20 - validates ok these - validates across the consensus rule and they look at this proof of work answer ok and each of them a test that it is valid okay suppose it - when I say - it is broadcasted right so now what happens is -1 fix it then -2 OK then it goes on ever
ghost foreign attestation and it goes till -25 that's it okay sunao each of them will attest up on 6 OK when there is a 6 at a station then becomes then it becomes a valid block OK then it becomes valid block only when it is valid block
it will be hard to change Ok only hear the block gets well did it before that yes mine has done is piece of work and it has all done but still he would not be getting there was once the block is validated by other group mein other - and once the artist that yes it is a right block then only it will get added to the blockchain make sense
ok so once again I repeat and I will take the questions ok so basically what happens if we know we saw that there are transactions ok after transactions in there where blocks get the group of transactions where club together in a block and minor starts to solve the puzzle ok now comes the race what if other minor also solves the same person ok there is there is there a chance
in that case mirror how does it work ok so the protocol itself as rules like what all things to be checked before sending before accepting the block and providing the reward what all steps has to be followed so those are nothing but it's called consensus ok and consensus rules if you look at consensus rule what are Little Check is supposed to blocks come at the same time it looked at like who's block size had my house so block had more number of transactions ok
ok if both have equal mm mm transaction that friend who has put in more effort to find the computation power to find the hash in the longest and we'll talk about it this once this has solve the puzzle and and he broadcast so other minor has to attest even though he has found the puzzle it doesn't matter that he is evil
not get is reward immediately it has to be attested by other - Once The Artist and make sure Meena and if if it gets valid only then it gets added to blockchain ok so I'll take up questions now this this is important. Ok question from
kahan so verification is transaction wise or block wise so overall citroen both gets verified so whether you send a transaction okay simple transaction from you send a one bitcoin to another person that also gets validated but on the whole the block also will get valid it question from Sudheer once block is propagated does other - artist the block as a separate process or ads to its list of
transactions to my this is a separate process transactions 2 - is separate process attestation is different process ok so question what happens if both - get six attestation ok so that is not possible ok so it is highly unlikely so that is where this longest chain comes into picture which I am going to explain next
ok question from JSON what if both - blocks KKR the same question right so we'll come to that you know what happens with the 6:30 stations right in that case what will happen if all these rules are same then what happens will look at it so that is next. Does network has list of all -
moment you run a Bitcoin mining software right so it gets communicated and it was like who are all the - question from Anand validation required for attestation if you look at Bitcoin right so if you have enough purchase Bitcoin Aarushi of send some transaction in terms of Bitcoin what happens is immediately you will not see that it has been accepted by the receiver ok it won't go
it will take 6 confirmations people say attestations are they could give another word called a confirmation only after 6 confirmations you know the transaction gets through ok so we'll see who worked more to find the hash how will they calculate so this is based on the norms number ok so you can suppose you have there are there are internal calculations have not gone deep into that
but there are calculations to find out like who has put more computation power sure questions from Sudhi so there is no reward for -2 artist A block soon know that I know whats good question Dharani it means one block contains transactions confirmed by 1 min
first it will be confirmed by 1 minus 10 then the same block has to be taken by other minors and then it has to be validated Vamsi Krishna based on computational power show latest look at the computation power
see I don't know the exact formula what they use so there is difficulty formula will try to find out once but the idea is you know the protocol knows you know what
the amount of work one has performed the computational power I'm so this one right so this one who worked more so that can be found out ok so practically Let me find out the formal and share it with you but the Bitcoin core protocol Network and find out like who has worked more for a number for example if you have spent nouns number 1
Dil Se 10000 ok so you are suppose so it means that you have done 10000 price ok block at the same time has done 1 millions and millions so in that case in a from the non stick selfie can find out like I know how much she has tried but I am not committing I will make sure that this the right formula doesn't make sense
1 seat didn't answer your question next to Jason can there be more than 6 confirmations for blocked attestation yes see what happens is for a successful blog to go through the real B6 confirmations after that if you have a number of confirmation ok so it doesn't matter after 6 confirmation things will the Block with get past and it goes on
also questions from Mohit so attestation is nothing but validate that shot 256 challenge plus me the condition now so that is one of the condition ok so there are other conditions is what we have seen here okay weather is in if there is a race if there are two if there are two blocks which are coming at the same time then it will find out let you know who has done more transactions okay who who's
Cosmo transactions ok who worked all these things should be taken care ok which Farhan which is the major factor for faster verification CPU power or algorithm CPU power the hash Krrish results will always be same for from all - Ne not be the reason being right so you could have the Khalifa in your mind right he could have
taken some totally different unconfirmed transactions OK where is Indian Myna could have taken different ok so doesn't matter artist patient confirmations also done by - yes what about the order of transactions to the order of the sea in the previous class I mention so sometimes there is a chance that you are transaction has been picked up you suppose your
call transfer to Bitcoins ok one bitcoin to Allison 12 Chali ok so I was first and second there is very good chance that your second transaction goes through but it does not matter it will make sure that your transaction go through it does not matter sailaja do you have mining software installed on any recovery I'm no energy theory I'm also be
will do money OK so the mining is more of a backend process is a blockchain developer people do not Dwell more developer or understanding purpose it's fine if you want to get into mining and you know the practical part of it its like you in a very complex think it will it requires a complete course ok question from Dharani A block can contain more than 2000 transactions so the minor has to confirm all these two
frozen then form a block and then it goes for attestation or for each transaction yes it has to confirm all the transaction there is no partial ok it will have to once you from a blocked then with that you do you know find out the number of zeros and then in a pass on for attestation so question from one see if there are no rewards for attestation then Y - 2
attestation Sudhir rules framed by Bitcoin core protocol ok so what it says is bus if you have to B minor you'll have to do attestation also only then you can get a robot it is not like you know so that is how the protocol defines role of a minor is not just finding zeros you should also attached ok so it is defined rules on sea but that's a good question
socialism what are the factors that minor need to confirm before attestation so these are the factors in you have shown your couple of actors ride block size who worked and find out whether the proof of work and service right ok so these are some of the sum of the factors ok so question from Anand minersville then not so much interest what test
so see this happens are automatically ok so it is not like in a minor can stop that station process it cannot happen like that it is software unsolved built built in ok so moment it receives this it has to attest make sense it is not the manual attestation ok it's not like it is going to find a blog and you know pass and some write some or provide your private key and then it is it's not like that you know
happens automatically the software take care of it doesn't make sense ok good so now so the reason this is known as terrorist condition ok block proposed by Lisa block proposed by Paul OK then what is happening ok how does the network decides which
should be next to the chain ok so that is what we have seen so proof of work is TVF scene right so proof of work block puzzle SBI explain like and how will have to find out ok so just go through it to this other mention like what is the header and you know what are the transaction random guess is nothing
pronounce number ok fine ok so just whatever we have done right so that's what is explain here next I am going to so why is it hard ok people moment why is it hard because that is every
it is it can be solved it cannot be solved direct way it is true only through permutation and combination you'll have to perform a lot of calculations in a per second to find out the right number so that's why it's difficult OK so how long it takes average in an average it takes 10 minutes ok so you can ask me like you know how how this 10 minutes average how it is taking 10 words ok so this is another concept
so why 10 minutes ok so what happens is bitcoin protocol ok so Bitcoin protocol adjust the difficulty when I see difficulty it's nothing but the number of zeros a difficulty in such a way that such a way that one can solve within 10 minutes ok so so that they say the Bitcoin so it will take different parameter
from the network and density difficulty level level suppose let's say we have thousands - ok in the network and tomorrow for some reason ok all 900 - route there is only 100 minus OK so the protocol are the software knows that these many miles are not there in the network and accordingly the difficulty rate would come down ok difficulty rate
it will automatically system boot tune in such a way that the difficult period comes down and it will also make sure that it takes roughly around 10 minutes ok so that the network take care so yesterday when I showed you again let me show you again so that's why if you look at block number one you look at the difficulty this difficulty number one ok so this is not said by anyone this automatically the protocol take care of it ok no latest look at block
1000 still it's one ok let's look at happened 8000 block then you see the difficulty level increase to 14000 now let us look at the $500,000 ok CV if we are almost in a one 1 billion it soon we will be in trillion so this difficulty factor automatically it is automatically adjust table
network OK so the next one Nokia so generally this you had questions in my like you know what is this Hash Function we are talking about sha 256 md5 hash what is it and what is about this has ok since 1977 even before that he is mathematical functions were there
ok so anybody can design Hash Function so tomorrow Shailendra if you want to create a has one can you open to do but what are the properties which has to be taken care of these are the three properties it should be collision free meaning if you send a ok for you get hash ok so always for you should get the same hai ok and for be you should not get
so this is collision free if you get a same hash for B then it it is it's not right ok doesn't follow the rules of the hash ok and it should be fixed number so it is not mention there but it should be fixed in number supposed this is like say like 3 digits for example 1234567890
20 digits ok so even if you if you give a it will be 20 even if you know it's a very big number it will be 20 pages ok in such a way you should find out the hash okay hashing algorithm so hiding me in the hiding if you see you cannot in a from from the hash output you should not be able to determine what is my Input and other third properties
muscle friendly or innovative mentioned is the probability range right so if you look at you know it should be if you look at it should have a large spread meaning that for a you get this number and for me it'll be totally different number it when it cannot be 123 it can be like that is if someone is trying to guess it should be a very large we know it should be taking enormous amount of time to find out what it is
ok so that's about it ok question from Shailendra can we download cgminer and try at least to understand Shailendra app you can do that but make sure that you know don't compute with the real Bitcoin powered see if if you are having a normal laptop or computer and if you try to mine it might in Auburn actually it will try to compute lot of things and let me guess.
make sure that you do it in some test network so question from Mohit difficulties what number of zeros has supposed to have if yes how is difficulty rate getting calculated for calculating difficulty rate also there are formulas ok there are formulas in fact I don't know
ok so so there are formulas here ok so find out for in a deep understanding
what we are touch what we are doing is we're not going deep into difficulties everything is Lagan on complex object ok you want to spend difficulty for that only will have to spend lot of time so high level what I want you to understand this so this difficulty will tell you like in a network what are the difficulty provides you from that he should be it will tell you like how many zeros you will have to find out in terms of prefix
ok so that's about it now feel ok now I am going to explain in a some of it and then take up the questions okay mining rewards record ok so this is quick topic ok so what I want you to show it
Vishal e so once the minor right so once the minor finds out the puzzle puzzle and its gets at a stated are confirmed by other minus minus would receive award ok so this reward right every 4 years it will be reduced into half latest look at the first block ever created you can see that the block reward is 50 Bitcoins ok now let us go to hundred thousands block
ok she look 800 mm still the block reward is 50 letters go to 200 mm ok still it is 50 Bitcoins ok look at block level is 50 Bitcoins latest go to $300,000 you see here it is block reward is 25 BTC ok now latest look at the late
block C 12.5 BTC so what happens is so this is all calculated by network ok so most of it is everything is done by network until we know the transaction signing manually in only those things are manually will have to do ok now reward reward how they've done this every 4 years
UK every four years rewards will be 50 Bitcoins first day started off with 50 Bitcoins moment that 4 years complete so then it will be half then it becomes 25 then we are into next one like 2016 August sometime it became 12.5 so now we have rewards 12.5 because then after some time is going to be 6.5 after 4 years this
will happen this will happen ok until 21:40 so why 2147 go to explain that also ok so when the this Bitcoin right when it was created it was created in the mind that there will be only 21 million Bitcoins ever produced ok and there is no answer like why this 21 million was chosen why this
battery Number 21 ok so why 21 million Bitcoins in the founder of Bitcoin tried he thought like 21 million was enough so there is no conclusive answer of liquid Number 21 ok so every 10 minutes once every 10 minute it's a block would be mind every 10 minutes late for every 10 minutes A block would be generated it will be accepted and it'll be propagated in the network
ok so every 10 minutes you get the reward of 50 Bitcoins in a by the minor who is winning it this goes on leg in a first 4 years it was 50 Bitcoins in the next 425 12.5 and it would take in the year 2140 by then we will you know consume all the 21 million becomes so that's the inner that will save it is programmed that is out the software is made okay lubricant ko software OK then you can ask me
OK then what will happen if we run out of Bitcoins are we don't have that then there is more more no more mining reward how does in a reminder survive so there are two things which are happening ok so - Get - get to incentives one is revolved OK so the other one is transaction fee ok
so nothing but when you send a bitcoin to Expression of your friend what happens you should also send the normal transaction fee along with that ok so what happens is minor gets both ok latest look at a block here so if you look at this blog which has 2700 transactions it has blocked you out of 12.5 Bitcoins on top of it it has where is transaction fees see it as a transaction fee of 3.3 bit
ok so all together you will be receiving 12.5 + 3.39 so this is this amount ok and ok so I will be receiving this what ok now question is what if it runs out OK when it runs out of reward still the transaction fee would be sent to the miners ok and what day claimers so Bitcoins value will be so high that the transaction fee would be
sufficient for the - ok if you look at in the year 2010 ok Bitcoins value was only some sense like in a fun Center to send something very low number right now we are sitting in $10,000 today morning I looked it was $8,500 ok so the Bitcoins value will be so high that we can you know it is this transaction fee alone is sufficient for the mind so that is the claim ok so there are arguments that you have this is not surprised and things like that
but that is a bit is written and that is a clean which is going on ok so did you understand the concept so I'll let you questions next question from Sudheer if there are less - does difficulty change from next block itself or after predefined set of blogs a good question ok
so what happens is this difficulty rate right so the question from Sudhir S so I would mention like 2000 - so now there is a drop off 900 - 900 - OK so how this difficulty rate when it'll be calculated ok so difficult period calculation happens once in two weeks or every 2016 blocks that is every 2016 blocks wants this difficulty rate is corporate so this is an algorithm
latest Garden ok so so so cute this is it okay so immediately do not change it will look at the previous difficulty level you know when it was it in exactly 2 weeks even it to 2 weeks once the difficulty rate will be adjusted ok so next question is from Thani only one ounce is mentioned for a block but it has so many confirm transactions in each transaction has an answer right but only once
launchers no mention ok so there are transactions ok for if you look at a block this is a what is separated ok block block has all the transactions ok it could be 2000 2000 or whatever it may be ok but the minor is calculating for only if for the block level okay soon on the on the block level or not on the transaction level ok so not just tired
the block so there will not be announced for each transaction doesn't make sense ok question from Sri is mining a continuous process yes even no one is buying it so mining is very beautiful concept if you look at it right so my name is mostly related to demand and supply until unless there is a good demand and supply for Bitcoin everyone would mind because they receive
2.5 Bitcoins and each Bitcoins values around $10,000 right so if someone if 1000 participants are going to drop off then you know definitely you and me will be interested to make because it is worth of $10,000 so based on that you know it is a continuous process question from Anand we discuss one advantage of Bitcoin no fee but transaction fee was is there who spoke
it is coming from ok so if you look at another very good catch ok so if you look at banking we were talking about transaction fee and Bitcoin its Menon transaction fee we are saying like Innova gainbitcoin also transaction fee so there is the minimum transaction fee supposed say for example if you want to transfer 1 million worth of Bitcoins you are paying $2 or $3 ok but that is not the same and that's not the case with your Fiat currency you'll have to pay a significant amount source
it's a very small about your trying to pay to keep up the network ok Mohan will my regrets 12.5 Bitcoins for each validation yeah if he has successfully mind yes he gets 12.5 Bitcoins on a hole question from Anand will not be the same for blocked irrespective of of the miners like the California Maya an Indian main event
call they announce the same it could be different ok so it could be different because he made of chosen at totally a different number of transactions ok total different number of transactions so it could be different it will not be same dons who spoke it is the fee and bdc coming for - suppose Anand if you have Bitcoin in your wallet ok and if you are going to transfer to
someone in our team ok so you pay transaction fee to the network ok you don't know whom it is going to go you pay transaction fee ok and this transaction will be picked up buy some minor in the network and he frames A block and then he Minds I tried so that my dad gets the reward fees make sense question from JSON will
Bitcoin business stop by 2141 space consumed all Bitcoins love it it won't stop what they are saying is this is like you we will be transacting with that see you one bitcoin can the ideas one bitcoin could cost around like say like 1 million dollar ok one bitcoin worth it 1 million dollar so if you want to purchase in or if you are going to a gas station if you want to feel and probly what do you need to give 0.0000
some Bitcoin ok so that's the idea that so the thought process in Om was created in Bitcoin Anand BTC question I didn't get your question problem I have to Unmute you question from Mohit is award giving given for generating A block or is it given his award give
for generating A block address is given only when the block is deemed eligible for blockchain only if it is deemed eligible for blockchain only after all the confirmations if it is accepted by the network and then adds to the chain only then there were will be sent to the minor Mohan then if they blocked have one or two transactions which have less than 12.5 transaction fees will get the same amount
then if a block have one or two transactions which have less than we are ok well I'll get to this phone is a good question I'll get to it yeah I will get to it that's a very good question problem that uses paying the fee that's right on an user is paying the fees paying BTC same question by Mohan and Anand
so if I send 1 BTC to someone for for the other person to receive in his wallet is it correct that 6 confirmation required for BTC to be transferred and then this mind for the record to beam you that's right yeah you are right so the block has some sort of ID of the minor doesn't have any ID
for sending you mean to send the transaction fee and Bitcoin yes ok but the block inside block it does not have but yes it is calculated outside ok I know that where some very good questions like you know ok when you say the transaction fees ok I know that in a minor user sending the transaction fees but who sends this 12.5 Bitcoins ok so this is done by the software ok
Bitcoin Core software so this is the very beautiful Idea if you look at our Fiat currency who prints our currencies we the government prints the currency ok so they take they found out that demand and supply gold reserve what are the factors it is based on that they issued to print a fiat currencies so that so today it's been done ok so in the Bitcoin world how it is done is bitcoin things like
no I know that every 10 minutes away demand and its circulates ok this this currencies write this currency is every 10 minutes the software and its doors currencies ok this 12.5 starting from 50 then next fourier 12.5 this this software emits that ok doesn't make sense Mohan Mohan at this question right
phone and Anand super clear in for everybody so once again I will tell that you know so who is giving this Bitcoins there is 21 million Bitcoin who gives what happens with just think about country ok so latest Ek USA so how do you USA has USD right
so we have something but kind Sir USA has USD so when people wants to use the USB someone has to print this currency so government would be printing printing for the citizens of their country right so they'll be printing so based on the calculations they do and they print the currency ok so based on demand they print the currency tried so similarly Bitcoins is a virtual currency ok dissolve run by computer and software right so this one's demand
supply how old is calculated is every 10 minutes release a bitcoin ok every 10 minutes at least 50 Bitcoins then after 4 years release next z25 12.5 and it goes on this is how many Bitcoins are you know that's how it is it comes into circulation make sense okay show
so this is what is mentioned here ok that 21 million should see see the limit of 21 Millions is hardwired into the protocol ok so question from Sri if we assume 21 million Bitcoins are mined what would be the winners will be doing do they just study is transaction
Modi will just validate distance actions ok so why did the block everything would happen they get the transaction fee ok only thing is there not be receiving mining reward make sense solo mining process will still be there Sri but the transaction period the transaction fee itself will be a huge amount by then ok suppose
1 million is 1 1 million dollar worth is one bitcoin ok so now you are the block which is shown you have 3 Bitcoin just transaction fee so what will happen is the minor will be receiving 3 million dollar worth of Bitcoins as a transaction fee that itself is a huge amount so you still people would be mine so many process not going to go anywhere it will still continue only only thing is mining reward will not be there
make sense Suno Suno Ji Suno pictographic lete is represented so challenge and the proof we are trying to find out the nouns and we find another number of zeros ok so this supported ok so now we will look into the longest chain concept so before that let us take it 57 right let's take a quick 5 minute break
ok so while we come up will look at the longest string concept ok
Anand where do people buy Bitcoin so Anand where are you from exactly you are so India the country where are you from US you can go to coinbase coinbase.com
it is not like buying stocks like a company like a Forex it's different thing all together can we convert all these BTC to actual cash yes when you say all the mean all 21 million
No 21 million drive so that different people will not sell it because you know what time the value gets increased ok if you see previously it was one Centre now it is an iTouch to put $21,000 ok so when people sell it then it doesn't make sense right so they lose their profit some people just accumulate
location from Villa
how can people sell the Bitcoin they own for Fiat money will have to go to an exchange and then select villas like if you have some dollars if you want to get Indian National Rupee what do you do with you go to a forex market right and then sell it so similar leave to go to exchange and then oscillate Mohandas all 21 million becomes are in market today no
21 million it'll take 21:40 think right now we are into 14 million or something
Tim can you hear me now ok ok fine here thank you ok so now we will look at the longest chain concept ok so longest chain so latest take that currently we are in block number 999 ok so then
text block which has to be confirmed is 2002 block ok so I've taken 3 different geographical areas to make sure that you know we feel that it is at a different place ok latest say ok at this juncture like after 999th block only 4 transactions happened ok only 4 transactions happened in the network then what happens so what is the minor roll baby roll - okay Australia minor Indian men and women
what is there job is to in a find out all the unconfirmed transactions and then start mining basically they are there how to find out the person so Australia Marwadi dresses he pics of this post transactions and then he start mining similarly with India and USA all of them are doing the same thing at this moment what happens if they all come up with the same nonce same difficulty level everything is saying ok in this case now there is a problem like
whom should a reward Lokesh all of them have done the same job and whom should I do what ok so here is there something called shop for happens ok its called shop 4K there to force hard and soft or hard we will see later ok this call soft food and then what happens is so 999 9th block after mm block right so what you happen is there will be mm block ok
say like this is chosen astralia block OK then they'll be chosen India block ok if you look at the blockchain itself is it will get divided ok now USA block will have chosen USA ok so like that it gets will get fork and each we'll have a different path OK then again the Ruby
the next after 2000 then next what will happen next house and one block has to be hard right will continue then continue to do it so it this block right so this 2012 Lok should be added in any of these three right so supposed say that person to unblock was mind in Australia ok so what will happen is he is adding back of it ok I mean whatever chain he finds out right nearby thing
ads 2100 ok ok and the latest say that this also had same transaction 1001 block was added here also thousand 1 o'clock was okay now we are in 2 mm to block ok now what happened there like 20 transactions are 20 lipstick like a bigger number let's take like 18000 transactions happened ok ok so now what you have done this
these 10000 transactions ok for Australia for some reason he was able to pick up only 900 transactions whatever maybe Dheere Dheere ok so India has big debate $109,000 8,000 what you say was able to pull an all these 10000 transactions then what will happen is so now you see all these your mind this Australia also has mind 800 8010
ok now what will happen is this 10000 block right so this will have will get mind and they'll be 2002 OK so the next block gets added ok now there is another consensus rule that ok when when there is a clash OK when there is a class so here there is a class right 2000 17 there is a class to find out like who has the longest chain ok so in this case you are
reminder has mind transaction and is added to the block and thousand to and here in 5 day of done list number of transactions and their chain is not the longest then what will happen is people will start following this longest Chain and these this one will go off Ok for moment for sometime this all will be 4 after a while the whole network will follow a single chain so this will not
be there any more and this is a very good ok so this is the longest chain concept ok so let me let me again explain so ke longest chain when the problem will happen is when all three minus minus on geographical e located at different areas so they pick and choose the transactions and then they start mining ok while doing so once they present the answer or the puzzle ones that work.
that ok it is the same like to 3 - have done the same thing same has power then that scenario something called soft fork happens okay the soft work is when we know each each of them forms their own chain OK then it goes on for some time like that ok each one whatever change you want to follow people can follow and they add ok but there will be a point like one change would have
longest one ok longest number of blocks so that changed will be rewarded in that change takes precedence of all other change and it will follow the longest chain ok so this Australian and their change will it doesn't matter it will go ok people will follow us a chain and remember so during soft fork with the rewards or not sent to the minors OK it is are all on hold ok so after a while when there is a longest chain
send a WhatsApp allocated make sense so I'll take questions for longest in concepts ok block resides on the network then why block depends on country so it doesn't depend on country geographical I want you to me now just just want to have a feeling that it is far ok but it doesn't matter
water sample transactions here and what are the samples some transactions is nothing but the Bitcoin rates Bitcoin you send from one person to another person so those transactions from Shri so whatever work done by Australia Indian men is gone waste that's right yeah that is the consensus rule ok so that is a consensus rule it would be the same for us also suppose
Indian has Indian -1 in USA mine would have lost everything but it doesn't matter so that so you know the rules are framed then then only people are calling like you know if you want to mine yes you can mind but these are the consensus rules on the rules are another rules can't be changed also rules are written in the software ok and it's not going to get changed and people can see that ok these are the rules ok question from
Sudhir Sinha example will USA - Get reward for all three blocks that's right yes we were you said block saddle Oakley what do you mean by that OK to India so what happen is people will not know which is the chain ok so in this case when there is a scenario like this when all three or in a same in that case network allows you to create your own thing ok but even chew little
into the longest chain OK will this happen within 10 minutes or over a period of time so tennis this this one will happen A period of time so it could take like another 10 more minutes or 15 more minutes for people to get follow the longest how USA will get the longest chain soap
how user will see another example also so it doesn't longest range is nothing but who see your mind super style and the your mind ok and you are formed a chain for instance there was a raise and you have the same people start started to add all their blocks behind your chain ok and for some reason you are lucky and you had the longest change then you get the reward ok and minor you know what - does this
find out where is my next to change in and then they keep adding it who manages the software that dictate the rules this is open source software ok like if you take Linux like minutes a common community ride can there be different transactions confirmed in towson 21 block of Australia and India and USA blocks that can be Jason good question yes that can be different transactions
can there be different transactions confirmed in thousands year the inside sudanese - can choose which change they want to follow yes they can follow looks like Mohit as a question but long question
ok so I'll Unmute Mohit so others one sitarani Vilas variable to get it means I am not reading of the entire names I hope you are not getting it
miners to have a set of unconfirmed transactions generated blockchain when everybody block
also so here if you look at it is not one my dear there are thousands and thousands of minors who are running the network ok sure so generated the block at the same time
and whatever is the blocks are different the network would opt for the block that has the longest number of Trance more number of transactions and what I was not built in either of the cases where to 1 Block would be accepted by the whole network West that's right ya know if that happens that means the whole minor network is maintaining their own blockchain so that particular block would get added on their cop
the blocked it that's right so how would this end up happening what your explaining is basically now they have their own so because so what will happen is in this case what you are talking as they are looking at the difficulty rate ok what if they are all equal see difficulty rate is equal and the number of transactions are equal ok and we're talking about 2 blocks right what if 10 minus are sending us the result
okay broadcast result and all are same you can always the same difficult period and have the same number of transactions then network network has to you know it's not like you know the rules are not like I will give you 50 50 ok if that was the case fine I will give you in a you have also done the work I've also done the work I'll give you a person like 12.5 just split a half and give it to you doesn't work like that how it works is there allowed ok till I can't terminate was says I can't decide you continue
to do your work ok so then becomes so soft food they think ok mine is a biggest Church in Sobha people try to add more blocks on back of 1 -1 block and others it goes another block it over a period of time when I see period of time maybe 10 minutes or 12 minutes and then the next block would get added and then if you get adjusted so that that is a good works but I am confused about is how we will ending up this scenario when you have 14
because this time the block is generated its broadcasted on to the network broadcast in the network ok but it doesn't mean that it was validated and accepted as a block until unless this attestation swore through so if you look at the block right so in case if you look at here you can always see
ok so I am clicking this blog if you can see there will be something called me change Ok you see here this is called me insane yeah ok sometimes you can see that this could be a food chain ok I think the blockchain that info at the only display the main chain results ok not the food chain this is but a fork is bound to happen because there are lot and lots of minors
sexyb Geography English just imagine that there are 2 minus set up in the year of the same location and I just for understanding purpose they both grab the same and we both have the same mining power they both do this find out the same result so there about all scenarios and then they were basically on the block level which block wins on the blockchain level which
convince is his daughters exactly thank you so question so there will be a loss of transaction in Australian India lose the thing yeah that's right Jason longest chain for using means using marathas generate more blockers Ammo box that's right
Shailendra right ok so now I will spend some time to show material ok so see here by time so you have block block 1 ok no there is a race so the race is she know that's why they have shown three different colours Orange blue and green so big ideas once you find a block you
before the previous box so that's Idea right so what happens here instead of Australia something they are mentioned Paul's blockchain Roberts box in Lisa's blockchain ok so if you look at here behind green there is a block added here also there is a block added here also there is a block headed OK then after sometime what happens when the next block is salt okay so next block in here also there is a block added here
ok and here also there is a block and ok so here here there is a get to hear if you see there is 123456 right here to hear what happens when the next block is hot OK Here The refer blocks but here there are 6 blocks ridleys has blocked
change having 6 blocks okay are having 12341234 ok so in this case the ideas everyone will follow Jesus blockchain because it has the longest chain so that's Idea ok so switch to the longest chain available so it another software itself will take care of in existing to the longest chain so so so everyone stabilize and then you think
what makes sense okay is in the question another question which comes in remind its what if there are some transactions which are the shorter branches ok so what will happen if these are some transactions in this Lisa's Pranjal Menon this Orange branch ok now we are all switching to the blue chain in then what will happen to the this blog of transactions you're so what will happen is this will again be sent to unconfirmed transactions and to be it has to be mined come
reminder make sense because we have not accepted the network is not accepted this block it okay temporary it said ok you are so f****** let it go but after while it said no you're not a winner so these all were not confirmed so this all goes to unconfirmed pool and then it gets mind again ok so here to see such transactions go back to pull off unconfirmed transactions
Nike store we are talking about we don't talk about hacking and cheating why it is not possible I am going to explain about that ok so this is what it is so ok so give me a minute so quick to graphically what it is done ok so I'll show the so these are transactions
bundle up public Wi-Fi the transactions is valid solve the problem and find then it's provided to the network to graphically represented ok so now we are going to look at hacking and cheating ok
emoji dare
let me try to share my screen suddenly and I'm for some reason I got disconnected ok good generally this happens I don't know for us it happened in the first two classes in fact but you know even this happens to stay with me
I'm going to login in right back okay and guys who is in the WhatsApp group right I immediately communicate so now we will look at concepts of you no cheating cheating or in hacking we look at that concepts ok so basically
what happens is as I mentioned in the first class okay in the first class what I mentioned is you remember the Facebook example UK Facebook what happens if you start sharing ok and just imagine that that share this is present in all the blocks ok another come back to you so that is Block 1
Block 2 block 3 and it goes and I'm ok it goes on and they'll be lot of systems network it will say like system 12 and let's say that we have 1 million for example I'm just taking your number you have 1 million systems in the network ok so in this case what happens is Facebook has in a samosa sharing some content ok so that is present in the Block 1
and this Block 1 is propagated in all the Machines ok and it is in all the 1 million machines in the network ok after that what happened is Block 2 block three things of get it as got added now suppose ok and one beautiful thing about this is it circular linked list ok Block 1 is attached to block 2 Block 2 is linked with block 3 and Sonam Kapoor so so you Facebook
if this Netflix suppose if you want to delete this portion of IT in what you have to do you suppose it's in Block 1 you are going to delete some portion of India for example say if you are trying to do that are your trying to reduce the new block kiya in what you happen is this blocks has will get changed OK then this since the chassis different this Block 2 cannot link to this one and so on and so forth ok this to the entire thing will get changed
then what will happen your network so there are 1 million computers ride so everyone is connected to network they'll think we know some hackers trying to add a new blog or add our existing block just discuss discard ok so everyone will start discarding this blog so that's why it is come blockchain is very safe in terms of hacking and all its immutable ok you cannot change the data using mutable Ok so this is number. Number 1 okay edit is not watch
edit change not possible at all ok so next next scenario was suppose there is after block 3 ok I am going to Adblock 4 so say I am a minor I am a minor ok I want to know what we have seen this we need 6 minus for confirmation tried 16 - are there confirmed it means that block 4 can be added to the
suppose I am a minor in a minor one ok so what I want to do this I want to fake a innocent fraudulent transactions to the network so what I do if I pick up 6 - UK some so I just make friends I will in a sale I cannot call Shailendra come will then I will call someone ok hey Jacob someone ok speak
call all the 6th sem let's have a plan okay latest University good power of mind OK then what will do if we will only introduce block and you just enough start mining it and just confirm it ok even though there is wrong right or wrong not a problem only need 6 confirmations let us come to an agreement let's all will get six confirmations and then let's introduce the block and we will get the rewards will share the rewards Among Us
I make some agreement ok so this is theoretically possible ok theoretically if you have power ok you have with this enormous amount of computation power this is possible ok but but practically this is not possible why it is not possible is in books its yes this is a hypothetical scenario which can happen because - 12 - 6 needs enormous amount of computer power
more than anybody else in the world should to build that such type of system it requires lot of money ok one has to spend several amount of things but still it is not possible with just 6 mins ok we need to have something called there in blockchain world in Bitcoin world it is mostly called as 51% attack so it means you should have 15% of the minors in your network who has enormous capability of computation power
going to you know speak a fake it only then it is possible ok so practically this is not possible ok for now it is not possible to to come into consensus to create so many note - like that interesting theoretically yes it is possible practically it is not possible what the computer scientist or the next generation scientist what the cleaners something like you know you might of heard terminology call Quantum computing UK
Quantum computing is it is the next generation of computers which in a with S and how much power which can do calculations in fraction of second something like that ok so people claim that once Quantum computing comes into picture is 51% attack is highly likely ok so people clean but but these are all these all ongoing debates which are going on currently this is not possible
ok so two things we have seen let me again recap two things one is first you can't edit the block if you eat it or change the block what happens is so the other you know will this all LOL linked list ok so if you change even a single bit from zero to one if you change the entire in this will not come to an agreement I cannot be changed ok so so this first case is not possible second case suppose if you want to introduce a new blog and this new block if you have a
if you have enormous computation power OK then and you frame in a group of people as theoretical it is possible practically it is not possible because to set to generate such a expensive systems ok so when she did you get it question from Anand will even
private blockchain require - private blockchain is totally different animals will talk about it once we get there okay it is answer is yes and no ok it needs and some places it's not like you when we get into the fifth chapter will look at it is it ok any other questions in terms of hacking or in terms of cheating the system
ok so this is what if a minor is trying to cheat in the slide what they mentioned is you'll have to provide the proof of work answer ok if the answer is wrong it will be rejected this is one and I wish you knew this hacking right so if you see this is a hash ok so even if you do a simple change the hash of the block changes
that's not possible so what Lebanese 11 guys trying to push a block with bad hash so although this can find this and they can rejected so this is the bad block ok so this project ok is it this is what is it possible for someone with extremely fast computer ok
highly unlikely so that is what they mention we need 50% more of total competition power of the entire system Centre Bitcoin network to have to win that thing so you see one another climbers why would someone spend so much 50% or more than that and he is suppose is trying to fraud the network OK then moment people identifies that this network
fraud you know the Bitcoin price will go down drastically right so then either way he loses so then there is no demand even has invested so much competition power Bitcoin values down 20 for example no use right so these are the things ok so question from Mallika why is called mining when there
Julie validating it is it is in the terminology Ok why they are called mining is when you say in if you look at currency and all they would say like minting currency ok m i n t a n g so when you print some currency notes by government write this in meeting or if you take gold ok for example if you want to take gold OK what they do if you want to get a gold what first step
you'll have to find the right place or right stone and then you'll have to mine that I will have to mind and find it and then you get the gold out of it so they are just correlated and kept the word coined the word mine ok make sense told that blockchain will be releasing 12.5 becomes to every minor for each transaction no Mohan this wrong not for each transaction for
is blocked so next will it take hundred years to remaining 7 million BTC to be released yes it will take because it is going to get half ok good question in fact in I have had the same question for sometime so you have 21 million right so what happens now it is 12.5 OK then it becomes 6.75 then it becomes listen that 3.25 and then net
one and it goes on up to the zeros value upto the penny level right up to the in like penny in Bitcoin World School satoshi to the sea level will have to build on sofa that will take hundred years almost ok question from Anand this very good question what is the use distributed computing power with all computers connect power connected okay so so we have distributed power ok but
all of them have to have solved by only one by one whatever maybe the power ok have distributed power whatever it is but still the ideas you'll have to solve 1 by 1 make sense so I'll take couple of questions and then want to next concept ok receive receive Bitcoin after mining that particular transaction is done or mining is just for record
receiver receives enough your first thing is correct receiver will receive the Bitcoin only after the block is mind OK I will not receive it immediately Mohan if each minor gets 12.5 Bitcoins for each block the miners are richer than the buyers right yes that's right you are right Morya
how to sum upto what we're seeing his first we started off with what is the current system then me Europe compared decentralized system so you are coming up distributed system how it works that is all we know we have consensus algorithm what all things are used ok so if you look all the networks are connected peer-to-peer ok and we use public private key ok all the validation happens by minors and all the blocks okay whatever
the transactions there it is it is going to be present in every everyone's machine is participating in the network so if you understand this Bitcoin and blockchain contribute to some extent yes you have understood blockchain Technology basically a distributed system architecture so what is the benefits of blockchain technology in cryptocurrency what are you doing
so you see settlement in real time that is this is the first thing ok if it was sending money from Bank of America to State Bank of India what happens is there is a lot of reconcillation happens behind the scenes okay bank has to be cancelled what is done and things like that so that settlement is real time here ok no need to do a separate reconcillation process cost saving transaction fee is very less ok security and resell SMC everyone has a copy of data so and
mutable right so it is more secured and immutable and user should enormity that is this is your Bitcoin you have an address you like 0x 123 something like that and no one knows everyone knows that this address as this amount of Bitcoins but no one knows that address is tied up to ok so that is user should invent
ok so so basically what we are doing since it is distributed mathematically see that the use of mathematics to create basically you have the copy of luxury machine ok so you all have access to the single truths for example if you look at the Facebook example what I've mentioned it is an block number 1 so everyone has the truth so it is not like he cannot change that records not possible to change Ok
so that's Idea now we are going to get into these are not very important for this on enormity and sweet ornament in cryptocurrency this just two types of currencies ok let me explain before that have couple of questions sent me take that question from JSON or minus today or individual person company by itself on and power
computing for many individual - those times are gone now it is its called pool money ok there is the company very popular company is something called and everything and nothing like that people are there it is a binding company now they have that I have with many individuals in a day all contribute together and then start me so we will look at in the 4th chapter details about money how these these are done today
no more interjewel - now the question from Denise will the consensus algorithm change or increase over time so you know if you want to change the consensus algorithm it is open community what happens is it it has to go for a walk whole public or you know the major portion of cryptocurrency has to accept and only then it would change so the question is yes it can change but only for proper reasons ok for
example say that there is a bug ok so there is a problem in consensus algorithm which is found out in your next one year or two so we cannot go without changing can proceed so far that say yes it is changeable ok so in which database this is stored this lecture ok ok this there a couple of things ok we the entire blocks and details are are
stored in something in on the physical formatted store ok but some lookup details like the unconfirmed transactions are there in the third third chapter we will look something called and spend transaction output ok so these details are stored in something called level DB you kiss a simple key value pair database called level TV make sense I am sad you a YouTube link video right so sad to the T
so problematic look so I am a video let me know where this is getting stored ok and how old is getting stored ok sorry good so I'm sure you're clear I'll send to the team again
ok now what I'm going to do it will take a quick look ok so I don't want to spend much time on it ok so I will high level I will give you like what is the Synonymous and pseudonymous cryptocurrency what is it all about and then we'll move on to the next chapter of the important piece of blockchain ok so if you look at cryptocurrency is so can I get a Quick menu in the chat window like how many of you have invested in
nahi type of router can see like a yes or no or something if yes just you when I get to know like a nap before I started getting the fire like BTC eat and all friends not interested ok ok mix of yes and no ok so what happens it's ok I'll tell you
Karan in altcoins ok fine ok now what are you want you to see there are in cryptocurrency is initially it was all first Bitcoin ok first Bitcoin came up and from Bitcoin then came Hariom then came something called litecoin then came then lot of times now there is almost 2500 plus cryptocurrencies in the market ok ok then some
like 2 years back I believe something came up thing called easycash dash Moon Moon ok xpg right now and there are many coins which has in a these are the two types of things one is called should enormous and another thing is anonymous
ok if you look at like a latest local Bitcoin its go to blockchain that info will take a block will take someone's address ok so this is address of that person ok and he has zero Bitcoins Nokia let's take someone who has
ok so let me know we can find out like who want but if you see here this is just address right you have a anonymous identity have an address ok and using this address people can send if suppose this is my Bitcoin address I can give it to people and say that you can transfer funds to this one and you get Bitcoin here ok so this is nothing but anonymous type of currency is nothing but
there is there is a number associated with this but no nose like who who has this account but there is something associated with it that is anonymous cooking soda numbers some coins something called as we care for someone came up with the concept like you don't even don't even need to have a address or something like that you'll have an address ok for temporary
this will change for that instant yes you can get store but that will not be associated with you ok you'll have a totally different something like to the outside world you give something called address one ok but in the real time you will have something called address its ok people Would Still transfer to address on thinking that it's you but you know after that this gets changed Run It ghost attacks dresses ok so
this these are called these are called to dynamic cryptocurrencies ok also the numbers are there is another good name I don't get it right now so some of these coins at these coins works in a concept called like how we have a proof of work like that if you say something called zk snarks it is nothing but zero knowledge proof this coins in
call to zero knowledge proof OK I will just tell the algorithm alone ok let's not get deep dive into it just for the sake of knowing it will know it ok and it'll be useful when we when we go for an interview or me know when we discuss with someone to be useful ok how is the creation of work this all of you might of heard or at least most of you might of heard about this Alibaba and 40 Thieves story
nothing but the ideas so Alibaba and the forty thieves what day do they go they steal from different place and then at night and then they in the open the cave and the dump everything ok so bees 40 Thieves everyone knows this secret to open the cave they tell some magical word and this cave opens the dump the stuff into it okay so suppose if you got Alibaba 40 Thieves like sub
son-in-law let's take someone ok so I am going there and if I'm going to ask Alibaba like you know I am make a treaty with Alibaba saying that ok can you tell me like what is the mean I want to make a partnership with you I found out what you have ok I want to make a partnership I won't tell anybody but you know just something they want to make a deal I want to make a deal ok so for that what I am saying is
have to tell me the secret key so that I can open the cave and I'll make sure that you know the key only then I can make a deal with you ok so that is what I claim ok so so here the house we cannot work this season going to tell Mikey to you ok you will know tried so instead of 8 instead of 8 what they are saying is see what I am going to Alibaba is telling that I will show you
that I can open the door ok you just stay back ok so that you don't hear my voice but I will say a word say something that magical word you can see that it is opening ok and you have to trust me on that that is only be you can otherwise I don't I am not going to make a treaty with you so and What happens is saying I just wait a long innocent just wait that contain Alibaba say something and it open it without even sharing the key is proving to me
that ok he can open the open the door so this is so there and I want you guys to remember this story it's no that's why I remembered zero knowledge proof that so this works zero knowledge proof algorithm works ok so if you call it with this cryptocurrency world it is like you are telling that your address ok you are the year using this technology and this algorithm
based on the Descent to someone but in fact it goes to someone else so the real address is hidden so that's the that's the beauty of it thank you so so so bar question from Vilas I have made transfer Bitcoin to wrong address is there a way to reverse it now done is done it cannot be reversed see these are some of the day
when you compare with the real banking world if you look at the the real banking even if you sent to a different person still there is a way that you can get it back but in this case it's gone Shailendra means it's a dynamic address right the dynamic address which will be generated on the fly like people not sure about it and I'm not going through PayPal I just used for buying stuff
what I hope you got it right so now let's going to the slides and she like whatever explained after this will take a break okay so anonymous anonymous ok so enormity is you have a name attached to it ok you have an address attached to it so that is an unknown enormity ok so next sorry I said it
synonymous you don't know who this should enormous is what you have a name to it so if you look at here so these are some of these currencies in Inferno there are a lot of currencies easycash Monroe is dash so there are different types of currencies so now but there are since you don't know whom you are transferring to their using these people claim that these currencies are used for
illegal activity like drug trafficking or some kind of kidnapping something like that the people use always there is a thread that enough for this type of currencies Nokia 5 so then but this is a double edged sword but this technology you can take it never take it somewhere else and use it for example an example was proposed there is a military you want to send some message
to the into someone you not to wear to the seven Torrent they want to translate this message so at that time they want to make sure that they get the message but they should not know like whom it is from ok something like that ok then they can use this zero knowledge proof algorithm ok so we should take this concept of zero knowledge proof and we can apply it to the real time use cases
Z cash is one it is an application of this zero knowledge proof things so there is a concept call view ki so it'll be ki which will be given you can train transfer but really if you see it will be a different key and some problem with it is like at least in the Bitcoin world you know whom you are sending so here you will be sending to an address after sometime that'll be used by different thing that is totally you are you are like
there is no ownership like you know you can't go anywhere tonight what would be the exchange rate sometimes if government says that this currency has to come down or therefore they identify the server and they bring it down nothing can be done this all the problems with it so don't know it is our Bitcoin sweetie have an identifier for showing importance of
short on money in cryptocurrency ok sir what happened she is sending some 4 bit to be ok yes address so sorry this all can be verified ok so where it goes everything so it is it has to be can be completely repeat ok ok next we are going to start with Programmable money ok salon
right now we are moving into the smart contracts and where we can use the blockchain in the real world ok ok now we are going to get done with this Bitcoin concepts they going to 12 minute ok so what are you do it let's take a quick 5 minute break and then we will catch up with the next topic so now its
9 so we'll meet up at 10:16 ok
ok too I hope all of your back now let's look into the concept of something called smart contracts that what you are mental ok I am going to take same Id you request example ok so Bob so what I'm going to do it I am also going to explain you using blockchain account
house window Bob is going to Bom Bom was planning to buy a car from Alice ok so this idea so what happens in the real world suppose if wants to buy a car from Alice one way is suppose so he can fit us in us we can go to craigslist we can go to some in Assam auto shop or something and then you can buy a car right so that is on way
so just imagine like 10 or 10 years from now we are all going to go online and find and find the car and then by even today it's happening we can buy the car from Amazon and stuff like that but we could cheat you ok Bob barbas making a statement that ok so unless what else is saying that ok I am going to sell my car for $10,000 so that is a cost of a car
Bob can purchase now from using Amazon he looks into the car ok and bob award he claims that I would need emission certificate if you the emission certificate is true then yes I can buy the car if it is not I am not going to buy the car so that is a box condition what Dallas this is she is telling that yes I have emission certificate ok from this also company and then she says that I have and then
the car gets exchange then Bob later realises that it was shipped the car got shipped it is done then what happens is Alice then Bob comes to knows that involves the emission certificate whatever she has got was a fraudulent certificate it is not the real one ok so now what has happened Boban 10 Alien spend $10,000 to get this car Ok you're interested ok it is online but still he trusted something then Bob
who's back to Amazon Amazon go back to try in East Amazon is just isn't ok so he just gives the rating and he picks and choose and then he mark alyssas camp but its not going to help ok ok whatever lasts last right now let's say like how this blockchain and smart contract is going to help this scenario ok now there is something called in a blockchain till now we have seen it for cryptocurrency right
bring something I'm ok now there is some contract ok which is written this contract is in such a way return it called smart contracts there is nothing but a piece of code ok so in this code what it is written as a mission passes if a mission passes OK then transfer kar
ok else no refund the amount ok something like that this is what is happening now what happens is just imagine it is all through blockchain okay Bob there is going to be a emission company here okay emissions company and that there is going to be ok
so now what happens you can just going to explain everything in blockchain world okay bobbers ordering a car instead of you know if the dollar amount I am going to say something called it ok if there is another type of currency like Bitcoin ok so what happens is Alice claims this is 10000 other so that is a worth of my car ok and What happens baubles
Bob makes statement that I want a car AC purchases it is listed this card is listed for 10008 days I will I will be provided emission test passes ok so this is the contract OK then what happens is so this will be recorded in a blockchain I can now we have block 1 Block to like that right side in the blockchain ok note
you know very important thing to notice this contract right only is emission transfer is past then it has to be there this is recorded in blockchain OK it is part of the blockchain in everybody is blocked this is recorded now what happens is Bob goes finds out that elicits listed for mm OK then he is ordering the car now what happens Bob is paying 10000
it okay 10080 send me ok but this will be holded by the network OK it is written and it is written and smart contract it will be holded by the network OK then what did you do is it will now it will wait for the emission company vision company is also part of the blockchain ok now emission company is what he has done as earliest as she has transferred the card to emission company and I
Ellis is asking Emerson company to check ok now emission company looks at LS car okay and makes a transaction saying that yes past ok want it is 1 emission test company says yes past then only this 10000 will be transferred to Alice ok so that is all programmed okay suppose emission test failed even the bomb has been sent 10000 equals to
Jodha you know the contractors network to network will find out the rule and find out that the emission has failed and the 10000 it will be sent back to back and car will be handed over to alyssa itself ok so these are all program ok once again I am going to explain and then take up questions okay in the traditional scenario what happens if Bob if Bob wants to know if Bob wants to purchase a car using Amazon
does that ok he has to trend send this $10,000 to us and we will just me know I'd love to just be have some faith that analyses going to send a ride car ok he got the car and he found out that this emission certificate was post these things are bound to happen in blockchain world you are interacting with the rules ok with the contract ok so you are not sending funds to the tour
person instead you send funds to the contract Ok baba saying that this is the contract does emission test contract Bombay sending some 10000 metres alyssa sending the car now emission company verifies and yes the transmission company makes a transaction yes this car is in a legit the emission test is legit then what happens this transfer right whatever contract holds it will be sent to Alice Alice in town since the car back
so this is how it works ok the smart contracts now I'll take up questions okay showcase any questions Anand can you start from have audio issue and just hold enforcing and we latest get some questions and then ok so question from Dennis when refunded Bob still
is the transaction fees very very good question will the minor still get the BTC reward is this scenario showing so dunham's ok so your name because you you are assigned to me know you are purchasing right ok and transaction fees yes there is some transaction fees your pain but it's a very small amount so you are not losing the $10,000 amount right when you come back to the previous in her you are losing the $10,000 amount here ok but Hindi
yes yes there is some transaction fees but I know there is but you are a rest assured that you are getting the right car okay answered your question is so the next question from Sri I am not sure if really blockchain required this application let's discuss over IT probly Academy YouTube you can come up with your Idea and she like what's so question from moving in this
example in blockchain well how would 8 Intercity of certificate would be validated ok so this doesn't support this ambition company is there ok so this ambition company should have got some certificates or something and they have a website and they claim that you know I am emission company X ok and this is my registered address ok I hope I answered
Vamsi all the party should be in blockchain in blockchain for all confirmed that's right that's a mandatory requirement this right Vamsi villa season this similar to the escrow options available that are available to current currently right you can calculate is escrow that's how it works right after certain period of time the release the currency something like that ok options that are available currently ok you mean to like a letter of credit
some kind of import export the extruder screw I think you mean by that Villa but it is all Complex it is not like in a programmed Programmable stuff emission company should also be part of the contract that's right yes he should be part of the contract question from see what is the real advantage of having blockchain right now business happening with no issues UK so what happens with blockchain right so why it is a
good question so things are working fine why why why I should have something like a blockchain OK so this is so simple example ok so what happens with blockchain is there is a lot of settlements and disputes happening ok if you look at the car manufacturer ok let us assume that you know this Bob balance is a simple example it is like a car manufacturer if if you want to buy a Honda car what happens is typically the Honda manufacturing
King company he gets parts from several vendors and then he assembles and then make a Honda car not that every part is manufactured by Honda ok so there could be some vendors who are who are for seating products ok so those all can be found out from blockchain ok really use this one sample use case like how things would work how will they bring the vision
free to contact you there are rules you can call the contract in such a way that you can bring the emission company into contract so you can literally right a piece of code that talks to webservice to authenticate certificate and then executed Contract contract cannot talk shit talk to outside world ok so that's all in progress right now ok so that something Microsoft is trying to launch that it's something called crib let's follow the contract can validate the
its ok suppose you find this contract ok you have the same emission contract today what is happening use you should have a manual person sitting and verifying it and in this case what is happening and what happens you send some amount to this third party and third party holds that one very fine and then sends back you can hear cutting down the middle man here we are making in the middle man this program here so that side of it
Bharani contact is for blockchain or for each block separately contract is for the entire project if the emission tries to force you can show the immersion company very good question from Aligarh like say if emission company is trying to force ok in this case emission is just a certificate which alice's post in this case emission is trying to force his father
blockchain he has gone through all the regulatory norms to be part of the blockchain and say the same mission companies using his digital signature to verify that yes this is a right test ok if you find something wrong even so this emission company because he has digitally signed that yes this is a right ka good question what did you say about Microsoft Microsoft around smart card it will come to that we look at the generation of blocks
Sort the time I'll explain more Sudhir sunao Shri very satisfied with the answer or should I meet you ok so just we are going to look at lot of examples ok we are going to see this is just
start this is just opening your eyes on like you know how things could be done ok Anand blockchain certification I'm not sure Anand there are some public since again but I am not sure like how good it is there is something by IBM also Mallika is this smart contract only for cryptocurrency offer all platforms its for all platforms so those that we will take a look
starting from O V class 3rd week 3rd week 4th we can V week we are completely going to discuss about that only this is a simple thing ok cryptocurrency is Programmable ok so let's not get into it so basically this is example we have talked to Bob Ellis by is a car online from Bob ok so what happens okay so this
locate the same mission tester Jain soda water example of gave given Mohan I miss something who will pay for this emission test in this example for wireless ok so that could be a list because this is selling the car right so that can be like you know those things you can define so the ideas you can set up a contract and the contract can verify stuff so that's the whole point of it
ok is there any other implementation of blockchain so here ok so preview know all this is till today we have looked that more about cryptocurrency ok and now we're seeing like blockchain is not just for cryptocurrency it is beyond Bitcoin ok it can be used for something like we can you something like smart contracts and could be program so that is where we are heading to ok so potential applications
since right now why you no mention this awesome I'm there are lot of examples these are some of the example settlements ok main thing is settlements and Asset Management lot of things if you look at our last session right so we are only going to discuss about the use case what is an overall blockchain use cases are right now just there are just know that there are use cases
ok so yes we are done with chapter 1 module so any questions like anything which you know we are stuck and if you are not able to proceed let me know so in this module we will look more into
boxing in last it was all comparing we will be looked about Bitcoins ok how Bitcoin world what is proof of work ok so in this it is more of blockchain again is a third class we will be brave into Bitcoin now give me a sec
Saturday what we're going to do is there something called distributed ledger ok we will look at distributed ledger and blockchain so with that we will end our class today so send in a still we are a bit slow I would say so in RC mentioned in the next week please join before half an hour ok so we can make up the time so far
stride so can we proceed in any questions any anything you are stuck let me know before you start so if locations good ok now if you look at imagine a world without data bases right now in current world if you see everything is database if you look at Facebook you use Twitter if you use a banking account you examples ATM everything whether you
I know you realise it or not everything in INOX behind the scenes it's all data and its all stored somewhere and that so we operate if you take a bank your bank account details what balance you got it maintain in the database so without database it's completely difficult ok now we are moving into a world called one database for everybody so that is like blockchain ready if you look at blockchain
roblox everybody is Nano records are stored in everyone's machine shit means what means like you are storing everyone has a copy of it ok so another example what I would give us suppose some bank account ok so Bank Bank of America ok Bank of America has a DB database ok and you are sitting in
ok so nice in India and if you want I access my Bank of America so what I do wish I can log into their website and get the details okay where is where is it is made in India some centralised server centralised database ok just shift your focus like what is in a Bank of America is database okay it may be huge don't worry about that but just shift your attention that Bank of America database is present in every
one of our machine it is encrypted or all the stuff is fine ok just imagine it is present in all the Machines ok like in a city in India I have a Bank of America DB in my local machine in this case what happened since I need not go on Axis you know somewhere I can access my own local machine and make some transactions that will be propagated via network bi but my database whatever Bank of America database is percentage
machine also you can do Not immediately think like you know how can Bank of America share its database and we are not talking me now we're not going to store that also so just to another job another total there is a Paradigm shift like you know how you want to copy so that's what we are going to that is basically blockchain so that's where we're going to shift your attention to Anand but you
memories required to hold that much of data so that's why I said like let's not get into that ok I like use data use memory for all all things like we are not going to store the entire DP so Bank of America it's just an example only the needed person we are going to store will see see that ok so do you know that exist and immutable hackle database yes that is nothing but blockchain ok
is a famous quote from vitalik so vitalik buterin was the founder of ethereum ok he thought like why blockchain has to be only for cryptocurrencies why can't it leverage something else the real in a real business scenario how it can solve this problem and then in a broughton this concept call smart contracts and you know this was after this only people started thinking like
boxing can be used elsewhere also and started its Tata call me ok and this is history of blockchain if you look at Bitcoin whitepaper okay Bitcoin was created by someone called satoshi nakamoto we will discuss about him in chapter 3 so what he called essence in fact in this white paper he did not mention it is blockchain equal chain of blocks in over the period of time things changed and now people start calling it as boxing
ok so evolution of blockchain OK so how blockchain got your world when you see that first it was all just cryptocurrency it was Bitcoin it is only ledger of transaction everyone has a copy of dog make some transaction money mining that save it was ok once really thought about inviting thought about you know why can't we
used for something else then smart contracts came into picture OK then blockchain 3.2 so this is nothing but you know someone I think someone ask me about Microsoft so what what is happening today is if in blockchain world the smart contracts everything talks to the internal data Whatever if we have like inside block data what if you want some data from the external world so in that case you know how it is going to be secured so
what is the third evolution it is called scriptlets ok still it is not released in the market it is expected to get released by the month of May ok so in fact last one and half years and after 2 years Microsoft is hardly working today walking into it and they want to release a good version I believe so that's why it's taking time initially it was called coco Framework but now they have been renamed as triplets I believe
yes it was called triplets nowadays call Coco Framework problem this has to be corrected ok so blockchain flow diagram what happens when you send a transaction any transaction you make a bitcoin transaction transaction any in any clean so this course this transaction so pull together in a block in a first transactions are validated then it's added to the block and then gets added the blockchain like whatever we have seen before
so major innovations first it was Bitcoin then the innovation itself like you know why can't we use it for some other industry use case that itself or second innovation III in a little smart contract and IV is proof of stake so this is enough for the purpose of slide setting them in but you know it is not like blockchain 1 people what they called as blockchain 1.2
2.2 teaser 2K blockchain wondered was popularly for cryptocurrency 2.2 smart contracts and other things blockchain 3.2 like you never seen before it triplets and external world interaction so question from Anand will be do any samples with Microsoft blockchain Azure
John Cena Triple H ok Plus is not yet released ok so and that is not the focus of this class will understand blockchain and you know once you understand this blockchain and writing code you can write it in Azure also not a big deal ok fine reasons why blockchain is a disruptive technology the reason being it is distributed suggest that is a number 1 if there is a distributed architecture all things we have discussed secured your blog
cannot be edited which is open source in nature everyone has a copy of the data OK it is flexible means like you can build mini Smart contracts out of it this consensus algorithm whatever we said like to dissolve automated these are some of the features why does a disruptive technology in the recently made of seeing our pm office like Prime Minister office as mentioned blockchain and iot is the next big thing
Ram see if you look at other Technologies write essay all technologies are important some Technologies like blockchain artificial intelligence reasoning I'm even government started talking about it so they want to invest a lot so that's why you should also in blockchain 3 does not require everyone to be in the blockchain necessarily
does lot of innovations coming up whatever you mentioned it could be possible right now blockchain the blockchain 3.2 is a in evolutionary stage we don't know it like you know what might happen we are right to win blockchain to the two stage so cute so now we will look at how blockchain difference from
a traditional database there is a very good diagram comparison what happens inside it is inserted you sometime back like the Facebook examples once you sad opposite said she cannot go back and delete database is nothing whatever you want you can do
kattaruvi one copy Max and Ruby 23 copy as a backup server to make sure that when you lost the min if one DB server goes down you can access but virus and blockchain everyone has a copy of it and consensus consensus is like in a when you commit the data what happens if it checks whether you have access rights to update the data okay and there is a two-phase commit like in to maintain atomicity
it commits into a record but here the consensus is when you make a transaction it will be verified by all the group and they are in the process of mining that is a block is accepted make sense invariance so here like anybody can validate if you want to be part of a minor learning community yes you are allowed to do in traditional database its not it doesn't work like that suppose if you are a Bank of America you should be administered
how to update the record for the integrity constraints are taken care of so question from Anand so companies cannot dikhti in blockchain version but have to adhere to The blockchain Western so companies can dictate when they use private chain ok so whatever we are we are seeing till now it is all public chain ok so public change company does not have any saying that ok
have studied a day with what they've got in private chain yes we can blockchain vs traditional database so we look at the dissertation like in the inner when you needed distributed architecture then blockchains are a good one ok confidentiality suppose we discuss about the Bank of America exam today it's a very bad example for blockchain ok so if you have you got have a bank and bank account details how much percentage
don't do that can be made public that case centralised database is a good on a robust ok since there is no single point of failure ok and then robustness yes block changes better it is like a in the mix and match you'll have to look at the use case as such ok it's not the DVR it is not like a database replace with blockchain OK it is not like that he is not going to work that way
you will have to find the use case and then see that which one is good fit and then select the and select whether it is a block it has to be a blockchain orders to be a centralised database ok question from Mallika how will or will the public and private blockchain Sheikh and snow right now
public and private blockchain cannot be no she cant it's not possible in blockchain 3.4.2 this could be possible but at this moment not possible ok fine we have got 10 minutes let me introduce about this distributed ledger technology and then lets in the class today or guys if you have many questions then what I would do is I'll take a look
send we should take the in a ledger in the next class in a can I get a Quick no no I'll go the majority questions or ledger so when I get in a lot
questions okay say let's start with questions okay let's 10 minutes but you know next week and mentioning that please join before half an hour and I'll be starting with the class ok so in case if you join late what do you have to do it will have to just look at the new video audio audio recording ok I am open to questions yeah go ahead so so one question is
does blockchain has a database if yes ok so blockchain for some simple things right sir for simple things to to store app in memory to do I look up there is a lightweight DBS call level TV ok I hope I answered that
then so public blockchain is so Kashmir Manasu public blockchain is like internet and private Internet intranet and what about extended the public blockchain is like open to all you know anybody can participate private chain is only for a closed community ok so question from Shailendra glad we finally store data
speed data get stored data get stored inside every block whatever block sites to see today what we do we go to blockchain that info and the and we find block number 1 and as well we find blocked number five hundred thousands interblock you have right got it so that is where all the data reception
you are most welcome to you what defines private blockchain we are not into private blockchain ok we're just getting started of what is blockchain soon will look and into what is private blockchain what is life cycle if the program ends the data will go no program so these are there is no Life Sahi classes this one rate is blockchain suppose say for example if you have developed a smart contract
until unless you destroy that smart contract will be there forever ok and if the program and the data will go know the details get stored in the chain it will not go away okay questions what is advantage of creating coins legs e-cash anonymous coins like they wanted to try you people think like a number there are certain group of people think that you know why should I am I know I earn money
gudilo to the government why should why should I have a student name whatever I should have it because it's a security thread if I say that if I have a 10000 Bitcoin to you when tomorrow someone might attack me so I don't want to reveal anything so there is a total different clean so that's why they were created Sri Dennis can you explain a bit more and how blockchain is more advantages in terms of audit trail ok so good question so audit trail rates
who's this information in this example would have seen so emission company does some emission test ok now there is like like out of hundred EP pasta 20 something got failed or Naino he has 4 something now audit company can verify that you know who has initiated this transaction ok no there is company x y z emission company X Y Z and for a regulator in it be very
easy to find out that yes immersion company has done the transfer in the previous Commission service company what they will have to look at all their paper records and find out that whether they were really issued or not something I will look into it there are many examples where we look into your details during the course of the class I'm going to Unmute Mohit so if anybody else wants to know
you know talk let me know I can meet you yeah go ahead with thanks question I have his arm specifically around so let's say hypothetically if I look at you right now the transactions are being issued by the hour
I'm thinking from the perspective Bitcoin died so these transactions are broadcasted on to the network by clients and the block chain is maintained by minors correct
everyone has a copy of it is it is not that main event is it ok I see your point So they could be too kind of nodes fund is maintained blockchain right now my question is why cant blockchain be considered as a database itself that is only storing Ids and any any detail about that can be student of different a database right so if I because I can see the blocked unblock has transactions you know data getting transferred some sort of
Radha Soami between two parties can we consider the fact that blockchain is nothing but a distributed database with in ABP every node having an exact copy of the database can this be considered that way and you know for example if you want to build an application at her which is which is basically the transactional information of whatever is trumping transacted is being student blockchain there any other metadata
like who is the person what's your name what's ur address and all the detail like What's picture of that person can be sold under different database and after getting the no.of blockchain I can actually go and Fetch the more information from database like would this make a blockchain a distributed database can a thing which has done that is why we are going ok so you know many of the questions you know I don't remember the name like anal questions that will consume a lot of
ok with me and when I give an example code Bank of America DP when to consume later lot of data should I really have that no it is not required you can take that offline you can have offline storage you can only meet in the transactions here ok so that is possible that is more than possible that is attached to be designed ok for cryptocurrency world and for open blockchain this is fine whatever you're saying is fine but for the enterprise use case or when we deal with large amount of data
yes the data will be kept offline but I am not there yet ok to give more details about West white like when when two people are transacting what I understand is that there is an inherent trust on blockchain at because blockchain wallet the transaction validated by different you can call him the miners her notes now how is that like as you said you'd like
compare being computationally impossible to actually we get the whole blockchain makes it difficult for someone to hack into it but is it possible that one one particular minor just so you know one time he gets one transaction which is not even and then you are so what if somebody got cast the transit
that has hasn't even happen will that be considered as a wallet transaction no matter what no no it will not be here so that's why this verification comes into picture so that labour Court ok so that's why it goes for Santa sleigh ride so when we know when you see that you have solve the puzzle ok ok when you say said that 1 minus saying that is this puzzle solved and never got the non
ok and it broadcast this blog ok this block will be verified in other transactions should be verified weather this transaction really happened whatever transaction the 2000 transactions what you have this transactions really happened they look for non sthamba then only they are tested my point is that I like it because let's say I am kind of something I will do so what you do you transfer you did not answer at all you say that
I have transfer 5 bit 540 make a Trance again and you are able to mind that also ok for some reason you found the answer answer broadcast2world you broadcast to the network UK so what happens inside the transactions simply cannot create a transaction transactions can be created only if it is digitally signed ok someone has to use his private key and then digitally signed it ok to the transactions whatever you created in that would fail in a father
vacancies for any anyone to broadcast a transaction you need to know the private key of the person who is broadcasting the transaction is is that correct and that's right so that's why I none of these are none of the nodes can actually submit of fraudulent transaction to be processed because if you have the so it's basically saying that if someone is able to get into my private key or someone is a way of my
private key that can basically present itself as me that's right here so also in the work in the business traditional enterprise applications in a workflow scenario if I'm supposed to be an approval of some approval of let's have request from an employee something now would login to my system se Appu but in case of blockchain my private key if if
dura holds my private key in the computer can approve the transaction on my behalf using my private key is is that's how I got located that's right yes you are exactly just try to understand it ok thank you thank you so anybody else want to have a discussion so question from Anand are there any other nodes other than minus what are they
yeah there are different types of notes there is full not there is no client not there are different types of node ok so we look at that in the 4th chapter just hold on for sometime I don't know Shailendra you tried to run something ABT get install autoconf GCC what is the menu what is that you are trying to inch
so any problem with VM right so you should contact support team trying to install Miner software problem have to find some tutorials Shailendra know but as mentioned be very careful in installing mining software ok if something goes wrong like you know me too could spoil your system ok especially if you open to
open Bitcoin something like that ok now sorry I got to know take another call let me know like you know in HSR totally different call so I do leave your feedback ok see where things could be improved 2 leave your feedback and thank you all and do not tell again not do not worry that we are slow in we are trying to understand the core
sex clearly so that enough for the rest of the chapter be easy for you to understand so do not worry thank you guys and I don't have anything else thank you all have a good day
