good morning team is my voice so loud and clear we good
tennis fine ok now will start the classes at 8 o'clock but before we have any questions this is where we talked last week and we were looking at the
what are the different types of nodes in hyperledger fabric so that's what we have seen any questions you somebody wants to talk to me directly I can meet you let me know ok Shailendra
I will send you that I will send to the team again so that good morning so I asked you
last week of the Year the week before here on importance of mining in private blockchain and since so the same questions around hyperledger also so like in a permission blockchain how is mining relevant because it's all known part is right so if all the parties are known then how does mining come into play so ok so my name is basically the word
new starting but validating it validating and transaction is legit or not in the Bitcoin world why it's called my name is when you validate that particular transactions in a set of transactions the network is going to Rewari with Bitcoins ok since you that is intrinsic value associated so that's why it's called my money ok the game that's why the word is kind as mine but I really if you look there validating the transactions ok
for the legitimacy of it here when it comes to the permission blockchain yes there are known participants ok so let's say that we have an 3 organisations or Bridge together and their working on blockchain solution and here if if someone is trying to know that the participants are legend and stuff like that ok but still someone can if someone finds this
they can break into the network ok so they can suppose there are blocks there are transactions OK what if they want to wipe out your blockchain transactions for instance or they want to send some dummy transactions ok so you been more you got registered that's all fine ok but you tried to send dummy transactions are invalid transactions you want a consistent work that case me how
how does it work ok so that is one thing right even the Non participant case for example that should not be something like double spending suppose you have for example for a commodity ok let's take a mango ok you have replaced purchase order for mango tomorrow you should not be is not delete that order it so you whatever your place displaced are you cannot from quantity suppose you have mention
hundred now you want to change it that should not happen ok so moment you send a transaction that will be a great way everybody and that transaction is validated so still that happens in fabric so is it true then that in a permission blockchain that all the participants should be validating because otherwise how is it to work right now and ok so all the participants validating so it's a good question so it depends upon the rules
to set here that's why we talked about this endorser endorsing policy and dialogue is there ok so suppose you there is a network where in previously we take your taking a mango is an example right so just imagine that this network is full of fruit sellers ok and you are going to deal with like 5 different participants for mangoes OK so the consensus can be only between those 5 hours
ok so all of them like others who they would be dealing in some apples or something else totally ok so they don't don't want to participate on this consensus so that case what happens is moment you write the smart contract code you can define like you know who all are going to validate this transaction who all should be part of this consensus mechanism ok ok ok
follow question is let's take an example so let's see if I want to have a private blockchain for my organisation and let's say its for employee motivation not its for for people who feeling in timesheet on a regular basis they get some kind or if the project is profitable Davidson coin something like that so where if if I want to build such kind of
platform on a blockchain in this case how is the consensus because if the company itself is the end of our end it only validate how will employ trust that the validity of all the things for that why do we need blockchain that's if I am saying if we do if you do that chasing if thats thats alright use case
yeah because a moment to you when you look at the blockchain that should be like in a distributor that should be many introduce her talking to other its on this you can have a simple database and try to issue some tokens some value write something in a student in short mining is your saying is more like a validation and it's also consensus provinces also right yeah yeah yeah ok thanks
thank you sir so that was so that was a question from Rakesh blockchain is decentralized of distributed system some articles showing be Sandlas actually it is a mix of both ok this week and call it as a decentralized and distributor why you might think like why it is decentralized ok because there are only 40
notes you can do mine ok so not all of them can validate you can validate anyone is allowed to validate but suppose if you want to participate in validating the transactions and if you want to do my name is a common user it is not possible it is both actually and other thing what I would do many peoples are trying to call it as you know they are Breaking the central
sister relationship OK you know there is no Central authority to solve completely broken and decentralized ok so that's why it's called sometimes called decentralized also another example would be suppose you run a smart contract ok you've initiate a smart contract for car company or something like that ok someone has to go on the contract ok so that becomes decentralized makes
ragasudharasa question from JSON related to my I had committed to transactions for transfer our the mining is not done for the to transaction even though my name is started had committed to transaction for that answer of the mining is not done for the two transaction even though my name is started
that should not happen this is a really that's not happen if you send a transaction ok so once you do a minor that shot that transaction has to get picked up you know if you can simulate and show me again probly at the end of this class will take a look
0k 0k them so so it's 8 o'clock so prob will start so have requested for one additional class that's going to happen next Sunday 8 to 11 in the same same timing it's going to be on Sunday IST so for folks another play it should be like Saturday night
so did you all get an invite regarding one edition class ok so probly look at your email you might see like you know that is on addition class Social in there is only one additional class for now yes
she like you know how we go today tomorrow and the next class and then you know if at all if it is required then we'll try with one more let's see when you but Max is like you know one more only Max and I'll try my best to get one more in that is that is total of 2 let's see ok so probly what you do it when you log into your meeting invite right so when you log into the said Eureka platform fine
Dude that they'll be on more addition to the existing or schedule a silent I mean not on Saturday only on Sunday that's right I have some work actually on Saturday so what's schedule on Sunday ok so any questions on this order
not appear how it works and whatever we are trying to do right the hyperledger what we are trying to understand hyperledger itself is a course actually that itself can run for another 2025 hours ok so we are what we are trying to do is we are trying to get a glimpse of like what is hyperledger what are the projects under it ok and what fabric this other than eatery in blockchain
and then we are going to look at some practical practical also we are not going to set up this order Pearson stuff like that we are going to get a simple business network definition and see like how things are going to work ok yes Mohit next week we have a class only on Sunday
ok so question like for finishing the assignment we can ping even ask questions so what I would do is I'll send you the project today win for some totally completely forgot I let me send you that movie cell project ok today before and after end of the class I'll submit the project after I like an hour wait for like 1 hour or two then you will be able to get the project try it on your own ok for sometime in the WhatsApp group
help me out not a problem but eventually the project assignment that days everything is taken care by the ID Eureka supporting so they they have a specific project coordinator who runs all these so they would be the right person to get in touch with
WhatsApp group yes we can discuss not a problem and I'll just give a quick recap so what we do here is there a different entities in the blockchain in terms of an hyperledger fabric one is called order then the remaining or Pears soap year can be one organisation or different organisation how are you want you can have different pairs
ok so what happens is ok so these are the other basic entities even when you look at the Pier ok there is something called endorsement Pier and committed committed fear that is if you send a transaction who can Indore your transaction that also can be defined I will give a quick example then will more so
what we discussed in the last classes like we can create different channels ok suppose we were sometime back we're discussing night selfie take oranges and example or in selling so in this case we can create a specific channel for all Orange sellers if you want to create one for Apple that also can be done so basically you can since it is a permission network ok so you can mix and match this thing public chain all the transactions are open ok
let me tell you another example so what happens is in the chain code in the normal world right so what you do is suppose let's take IBM let's take Bank of America ok so Bank of America has IT requirement like they want a project with example so they want you to transfer this project but ok I have for exam
say that IBM Accenture and and CTS ok so they all are competing a for this project but so what they want to do was so so all of them they continuously go Forbidden they do billing or something like that project be done building everything happens here so just imagine if they all have same channel ok see if they all have a same channel what you happen is
really everyone would know that some transaction has gone initiated between action and Bank of America IBM so you know like you know you reveal who are your computers and suppose there is some invoicing amount which shall I say invoicing of $100,000 ok so IBM assistance Accenture Road know that something has gone probly he finds out that they have this is the information for this purpose ok so to avoid this in the public change this
what happens right in public change What happens in ethereum public chain you know what is the smart contract codes correct you can look at the smart contract code and you can find out like someone has initiated transaction so here what they do is supposed they want to have some confidentiality they create a channel for IBM really in a dedicated
example but what I am saying is to maintain confidentially and to have the trust of peers we can create separate channels so we are in this case IBM SAP separate channel actions as a separate channel in Siti separation whatever they discuss and CTS can have multiple piers so if you look at IBM raid so IBM as a whole they'll be working with Bank of America but IBM in IBM also there will be lot of divisions for example it say that
Technology wise lecture that you know they have something called me friends they have something webapp ok they have something called data related ok so all these can go under 1 or 1 channel so this is paper specific to IBM so they are rest assured that everything goes in confined and private channel so that the data won't be tampered the way so they are assured with that
so that's about it just about to this private channel why it is used for ok now I will quickly tell you like you know what happens in terms of transactions how is it getting validated how does it work so so how things
here is ok so there entities let's say take that order ok and lipstick car is an example let's take BMW manufacturer and BMW parts manufacturers for example ok so there are these parts manufacturers there are different type of nodes ok one is the tire manufacturing this is stealing will manufacturer
Anantapur to prepare to MP3 all of them not here so what happens this first see Aise mentioned last week order is the one whatever transaction you send ok order order is the one who groups or in a valid is the transaction and arranged them in order and then distribute shit now let's say that
Pier 1 submits at analysis that Steering Wheel one some transaction he makes about Steering Wheel OK then what happens ok even in a blockchain it is like that right everyone have is having the copy of the ledger ok so this one is the ledger ok this one I say that so all are having a copy of
call dl1 ok just anyone and everyone is having an ok now what happens this year sending a transaction that I made a steering wheel or something like that ok then what happens there is something called smart contract could we write before that even before making transactions us
what contract code on in the hyperledger fabric world is called chaincode ok so called chaincode in the same code one can define ok so this endorsement policies if I make a transaction ok if I make a transaction who all should Indore in this case letters take that P1 P2 and P3 has to endorse ok so
recent set transaction about Steering Wheel what happens is everyone has ledger L1 ok so all of this transaction goes to the entire PS ok all the List of PSU are mentioned as per endorsement policy ok so this training will translation go to peer 2 and tier 3 first day find out and you know they endorse is there and also the end of like their up some basic checks they do and the end doors
top of endorsement what they do if they find out ok so they all execute the same thing code ok so if suppose for everything could ride once you executive it you'll get result and set order Aircel Indira so suppose let's say that a + b is your chain code
under advisement lipstick that Steering Wheel ministering number is steering number is 100 right now ok so the chaincode states that return Steering Wheel plus one so this is what is written anything could and I am just taking a very simple example ok return Steel
plus one so this is what is written in the chain code okay hearing plus one service return the chain code so what happens if so from this ledger Pier one says that I know it's hundred and 100 + 100 on soap year to also will do the with his leisure he will first 10 days and then he will try to do the same computation Steering Wheel plus one he will also give the results 1.1 ok so same thing period 3
also will do so this also will become one at 1 now what happen is the L1 L1 is one who has initiated this transaction what you would do if you would collect all these responses from multiple peers ok all the endorsements years ok and package and he will packages the packages into a transaction and it will be sent to order ok so now what order gets order gets enough
girls give me a min guys ok so what happens is order gets all these details he gets all the endorsement responses plus what is the current state which everyone changed ok so order will validate ok Pier one has given or No 1 OK what about others
here to also wanna one that's fine and PS3 also he will validate and you will check whether the endorsement responses were valid after validating what you will do it you will find out whether order also want sailaja right order also has the same L1 ledger ok so order against his leisure he will validate whether you know I also get this one or one once I get this one on one then it read it is assured that in all of them have
executed and found out that it's the same now this result order has verified validated order has validated and then order would distribute ok he will distribute that saying that this is fine now all of you can go and come it so he says like he distributes so that's when the last class we say we and the right so this is orders jobbers validate and distribute it distributes to all the pear all the rest
11 years and these pairs what happens they will come at the transaction ok so they are fine with it so what they do if they will commit the transaction now XI state becomes hell 2 so all of them have a copier new luxury so it's going to be held to know the value will be from hundred it is no change to 1 o1 make sense any questions
yeah Shailendra change kiya to be on the one who is alone so there is known as I just Taken 2 can example as ledger alone there is no one called everyone ok see these are the transactions which are stored in your chain discount ledger alone just taking these are nothing but the blocks
what is steering number no its just random example like the steering wheel right ok so producer produces a steering wheel currently has produced thousands Steering Wheel 100 ceiling wheels now yes producing the new one ok so jason's question is Sunil this computations that bears are doing or for quality check by PF no
this is the design so that designers moment you get a transaction from appear ok first if you are an enduring period have tenders it ok and addition to that you should always ok this is called simulating a transaction ok the right word simulating a transaction ok so it will stimulate and find out in the answer and then broadcasts to the requested period
make sense that's right but who gives this computation ok question from Shailendra who gives how fares will come to know that what they have to what is being verified by the verified ok ok so how each one of you almost all of you have the same
okay moment what we do here is like what happens with the smart contract everyone has a copy of smart contract right here also everyone will have will have a copy of chaincode ok so Pier one also will have a chaincode here to also will have chaincode here 3 also will have chaincode ok and on top of that what they will have like what we store in state DB right we have level Di be right here
you can have the couch bb11 TV ok so again I'll call level db so to maintain the world state so here also their availability be same concept only now here when will be initiated this transaction what was the transaction so inside the string code is what in inside the steam code this code is nothing but Steering Wheel plus one as simple as that in this feeling
the code was written as return the steering plus one this is the same code as simple as this this is why it is written in all of them have the same copy of the steam code OK got it Jason did you get an answer Shailendra level TV will be installed
each pair that's right by default red when you install appear you by default you get a level 3 like how you do it in ethereum right once you install your ethereum blockchain that is Goa theory I'm ok I want you download your get and install buddy 4 level DP would get install the similarly same way once you deploy fabric you get a lovely find gas so this is how the hyperledger fabric works first transaction is
she added it goes to all the relevant bears bears in pairs are not validating here so simulating and they all send back the result the result is being forwarded to order order will check what happened what are the responses and what is that what is the simulating response and once they are all same order will issue and commit
ok so but what order is verifying order is what is validating ok see this year what year is doing is he runs again this chaincode and sons about the result is not validating anything he is not checking whether you know this has to be 1 not 1 or whatever all palaces in a this is my answer and broadcast all are doing the same
not validating whether this is right or wrong order is the one who validates yes this is a right answer me and he is running but validating so it will validate whether this is a 181 and were not on is a right answer ok and then distributing it has to distribute to the entire node appears that commit the latest ledger
good question in other question from 10 is that right ok so what happens what happens if one of the Pier gives a wrong answer this from tennis suppose ok this year has the spear has logged in later in a user is not in sync for example ok so for example this is l
as soon as you put your money machine like a fabric what will happen is the first step it what will happen is it will sync with the existing ledger ok for some reason said it has not seen her sometime consume something has happened so in that case what will happen is you know that is what your PB if he tells you like so if you go down deep OK then so what happens is how many do you think has to have
valid response supposed here we are saying like in my group ok if you agree I am find to commit with a ledger ok or I need all three to agree ok if you have condition like all three transaction has to be agreed ok in this case it won't because one does not having the latest ledger in this case whatever your transaction whatever your send will be rejected ok so this will not be stored in the ledger
make sense Sudhir association and commit in this example is part of consensus mechanism that's right exactly so question from Shailendra like what will happen in case of database size is used so it is a very if you look at
master tried it is a very less storage it is what you call it is very lightweight DB it is not going to store lot of the details your level DB right it stores only the state variables and especially in the permission network it is only going to store pertaining to your network and you are saying it mean if you are going to work with the particular channel only that particular channels information is going to be stored so it won't be like another storage
that's not be a problem ok so the condition is said by yes yes right
this is a BMW you can do this is part but you are not able to meet you Mohit probly I think you are muted from your end
Kashmir on 2nd cannot hear you can you ask yourself again
for some reason is there can you hear me now hello Jason
Sunil can hearing or not
yep
love
tin can you hear me ok ok now get a sound is my voice breaking still ok I don't know I didn't do anything actually
ok ok fine ok so there was a question from Dennis all this will be stored in ADB over a distributed network so it will be stored in a distributed network all the policies everything will be distributed
snl yeah I have your good so awesome what I wanted to understand is in case of a public blockchain like Bitcoin or ethereum the transaction him published on to the blockchain and their broadcasted to all the notes in Evernote is maintaining their unspent transaction process transaction commit transaction in every node is generating A block and then there's creating the blockchain and then they
you know got casting The generated block on to the blockchain that's it and it is very fun and distributor in there and then there is ultimately puts the block on the blockchain is it correct so when you when somebody wants to make a transaction they would
cast on to the network so it would only go to verify and distributors got not to All Fears is that correct no no no she moment if the Peer is going to broadcast a transaction it will go to the respective respective pairs that is you have something called endorsement policy here OK so the endorsement policy says like whom do you want to get in touch with
ok ok for example you write a chaincode OK so this change code is deployed by BMW for instance they say that a steering wheel change code has to be accepted by 5:30 p.m. ok so this is written in the none of this is mentioned so what happened this moment you brought cashless transaction it will not go to all of them in the network but it will go to the relevant years
right but my point is first to have to go to vnd and depending upon the endorsement policy vnd would assign it to particular page isn't it like that how is it like that every pianos on its own endorsement policy and according to the right legs up the transaction everyone knows the endorsement policy all the pairs know what is the endorsement policy is ok and wanted to doing then in how is it coming into picture of slightly confused now so you see
what happens here is this period is initiating a transaction ok so there is nothing to do with order right now he knows like whom he has to communicate with soap year one knows that he has to send something to clear to and Pier 33 he sends or broadcast this is transaction to peer to unpair 3 ok this example I don't know if your able to see my screen ok you can write so so Pier 1 and 2 this transaction goes to
P1 P2 P3 ok now remember there is no validation validation is happening till now ok here to unpair 3 knows whether it has two indoors this or not ok that policy is already being said it knows that whether it has to be endorsed ok and the first step endorsing step the next step is simulating step simulating step on it does is it doesn't care about what other pair does against the chaincode what it as it is
submit this transaction ok this transaction whatever transaction it is received from Pier one it will in a verify When I When you verify it will simulated it is not going to update the legend of thing is not happen it is going to simulate against chaincode take back the result and send it to the same here who has initiated the transaction type should be sending to the same here in this what your best for have given you this so all the players who are in a one period and it here they all simulate
and tell them and tell them Ki Lagan what is the result and the result is in back to be alone so so what what about vnd for end it doesn't even come into picture till no no no no no so let's find standard quickly we have unpublished transaction and only PS3 and PS4 let's say was supposed to participate because of endorsement policy so only VIP entry at 5 got the got the transaction
discriminated the transaction and their send the result back to Pier one Nazri Resort but why is this happening like that that's a design but no that's something something that is wrong in the public blockchain because of that because there are going with the design right and what is that reason is what I am trying to understand any possible I'd like to make sure that you understand the order UPPCL
SOL this goes to clear all these are not gone to Pier 1 and Tier 1 I know he does not commit to the Legend has it is ok ok fine they are all verified that my transaction they've been indoor sing it and have done some simulation hear what does not know like you know what is being simulated and stuff like that ok so it is here one submit a response to order ok order is the one who validates when I say me and it's nothing but Valley days
weather whatever your simulation or 10 ok here and simulation is 1.1 good ok here to simulation is 181 that's right here 3 simulation is made up here to simulation is right PS3 simulation is right so after verifying all these then he thinks like in it also has its own ledger right so it has its own ledger so it will find out yes all of them have got the same simulation and things are right
now let's go and come it then it disputes the transaction again since when you go out and distributed send some message and people can update their leisure ok so it is this are you clear design aspect we look at it next but till this audio player how it works slow why is here so that the dash generation for the current block is done by each and every p
and the patient has to the order in the audible matches the Harshita Navy Pier that has processed it in then put it on to the blockchain correct I did not mention hash out alright I'm in so there is no has coming into picture when you pass the transaction on hyperledger blockchain just forget about all this fashion doll okay normally what happens when you when you send Bitcoin to someone okay internally for
come because its getting highest but ultimately it is nothing but a transaction it is getting highest only purely for the security purpose they don't want to that's why it is getting has tried so I just doesn't matter so you get a transaction got everyone ok thank you so when you look at the design aspect so the next question like in the design aspect if you look at them
everything okay anybody can validate if you want to be a minor natrium world you are good to go ok all you need is a good hardware you can go out and validate the block you know that is and they have something called this proof of work you do nonce Calculation and then and then that's how it is done here the mechanism is something different they control using this endorsement policy ok public key infrastructure and order ok so order make sure that
transactions are all fine you know no one has cheated right so if you send some so this this is taken to categorise enterprise blockchain they wanted it was the access control they want to actually make sure that no period is actually with intently purpose of processing the transaction they wanted did use this channel so that the same infrastructure can process multiple blocks change and they want to validate the result even before it becomes a father blocks
trailer 3 VR under in the real time another question in which may come in your mind is all of you like there is only one order that he is performing all the validations and simulation ok and how can we trust the order so order it can be multiple I suppose you think that should be another order ok in your network and if you want 10 orders yes you can create an order not
send the sinking between them happens ok fine then there is a couple of questions I'll take and then we'll go to the next topic how the peers would be chosen who will do that ok so pure fruit juices Sri it's a question free so suppose this is a BMW network ok so this is all about supplying different parts ok so bummed
knows that who are there when does ok who manufactures my steering wheel who manufactures my tires so for them BMW without saying that you know you'll have to ok find URL in the database system in a going forward you'll have to be participated in will have to participate in blockchain network so he will select the PSU make sense Re okay question from Shailendra it should go to order for validations
trip yeah that's right cylinder yes then Pier one will commit no committing ride everyone will come it when I say validating ones order things yes the responses which I've received is right the simulation is right then it will go ahead and distribute so that everyone can commit to the latest state ok
Rakesh what is composer nitrogen we are not there yet Rakesh will look at some example in fact will do some work in hyper composer today fine so sry I hope you got it ok so now let's about others Villas
Lavika Jason Gayathri Farhan all good
fine so this is where we were last week think there was a different we complete membership Babli we are completed all the stuff in a minute
so consensus in hyperledger consensus here by default it comes with P B ft permissioned Byzantine fault tolerance remember in the class 2 we look that this general story major-general story how the attack not attack so that is this by default it
is with this consensus algorithm but you are allowed to change you know you can change if you want a different consensus algorithm you are good to go ok and this what we have seen OK what happens just go through one's explain whatever you explain this so next is ordering and ordering and validating so we said like we @ validating and distributing so that
nothing but you know it it validate Orders and distributes to the for all the Pier so that they can commit to the ledger make century questions these are logical separation ok this is if you go and search like is there in a validating there is no specific glossary for it it is logical operation
V next is application programming interface in hyperledger when you look at hyperledger ok we look that different things we look the tenders we look that endorsing policies how to write a chain code for all of that you have sbks speakers or nothing but you know my software development kit tried to solve JSON based rpp is a restful API is are there
okay under previously the chain code on all can be written only in golang right now you can a node JS also there are libraries right now not production ready golang is production ready JavaScript and Java they are not production ready but they are there released it and I think probably they are going to add and some Python library so so this gives you high level like
what all you can do with this APS ok sofa repair if you want to create some enrollment certificates you can do that sending a transaction creating a source of a transaction all these things can be done so as a developer standpoint most of it will be events ok and will be using chaincode some of them this identity and all will be
security person like in a day would be showing certificates are different aspects to it so again this is me know how they built ok so it's a typical it follows the typical MVC model where you have so the chain code writes the chain code so here is very great all the blockchain logic now we have seen
Steering Wheel + 200 simple chain course you can maintain that and why there is a data model and control logical suppose you have some heavy data and if you want to store somewhere outside the chain you can do that so that's why they have something called data model ok blockchain logic and then vuelogix always you know that you are a separate break
find under this one is network topology network topologies like what type of network you are trying to build ok we'll go from last so the participant hosted internet intranet so it means that you have organisation within your organisation you want to build a hyperledger fabric solution so you can do that no internet with any organisation you can go and build the next to undisclosed this one is closed source cloud hosted one network
suppose a in BMW will take only one network only within BMW instead of internet they want to host internet solution but it's on top of a cloud that is possible and suppose if you want to bring multiple organisations together that is also possible ok these are the main types of topologies ok so what are the other hyperledger projects available
ok here any questions so this one is hyperledger iroha so probly in this project is developed by my company AC so this is a row is nothing but I know they are trying to create cplusplus writer libraries right now if you look most of it
Java best libraries and node SDK is David to create summary cplusplus low level libraries so that I could utilise the platforms so the whole iroha Framework is to develop libraries on cplusplus ok so that's what they are working on so I don't want to go deep into it so then now we are look
net fabric ok fine fabric initially it was so its even though it is Linux Foundation so the major contributions from IBM and dtcc and there is one more company so as you all know that is a permission platform where it is written it is all written on the go programming language theory and hyperledger Fabric they all want to go with this goal and see
should give few more rich features and also since it's a c language you have more control over memory so they want to go with the golden so diesel write the third one what it can also say what is this is like you know you can have different groups suppose if you want to bring a steering wheel group like I know there are three vendors who does Steering Wheel you can create a private channel for them
you can create different set of rules and permissions role based permissions group based permissions all those can be brought into the hyperledger in the Italian gold if you take there is no no rules nothing like that there's no rules anybody can mind if you want to become Aamir participant yes you can do if you want to just wanna wallet you can do if you want to have a like client wallet you can do but here it's not the case
so the next one is a question from 2D or all this project part of hyperledger Consortium yeah it's all under hyperledger roof that's right side raise my voice is gone how about
I also facing same ok ok fine yeah so there is a question from Sudheer like to join recently with hyperledger Consortium so can repeat be considered as a hypervisor Project no so this Consortium right so what happens is so every company wants to say that they want to contribute to hyperledger ok
let's take IBM for IBM by default right shift TCS is join in TCS Wipro is joining so they are showing some interesting so when they go to when they go for a project bit or something the showcase that you know I am being with this Consortium I help developing the psychology project I think through that what is the next one ok
fine and I don't know what today looks like there is some voice breaking your if it happens again let me reason ok so that's only way so question from seawater all companies using fabric in a mini Apartment I think almost
65 companies or something Apartment ok with fabric you can look out for us we can check out for fabric Consortium members ok fine now let's not there is a question from Mohit so even in case of hyperledger it is computation me impossible to rewrite the blockchain
it seems if you have one private Internet and some hacker hacked into multiple peers he can rewrite the whole hyperledger blockchain so first of all that that's what right so if someone is coming into the network he will be having the public and private key ok so LOL those will be only if you have this entire control the policy have a controller for dinner if you want to do something
only then so there are security rules for that you know so so that it doesn't happen in public LOL it is even risky so that is imagine public world anybody is allowed to participate bikini not install a virus nothing I get right you can know firewalls nothing you can go ahead and participate ok so that's why there is a major is 51% attack is all thought about in the public network where is in the private network
it's all your chain you know what standard she'll have to follow in a focus is not there for you in terms of hacking into multiple Peer but suppose if you are acting as a malicious fear it will be identified free like IBM is using IBM Wipro TCS all over a typical Indian companies Bank of America many companies are using it
sunnext modular architecture so modular random means like you know plug and play can choose what type of consensus you want what type of certificates you want to shoot your hyperledger fabric all this is plug-and-play ok so these are the major things so next one is how fabric
ok we have seen it already first one is so for every participant the issue something called certificate so we did not go deep Devi did not the deep dive into certificate how ok if I am going to be here what I should have ok so those are more specific details in slow like a public private key here the issue something called certificate
so the next one is so this is this again the membership services membership services nothing but certificate will have to enroll themselves to the power to be part of the chain so the transaction when you send a transaction again it is encrypted so that its not like you can open and see like what transaction has gone in a similar to work yttrium blockchain release on smart contract system that
this is nothing nothing but like how you have a smart contract right by default in a blockchain ethereum blockchain what happens if we have a copy of a smart contract period is called chaincode and everyone has a copy of the chain code and only only difference here is that particular chain code is stored in the form of docker container ok for security reason ok so this particular chaincode whatever you are going to deploy
that'll be hosted in a container so anybody how many of you know docker containers can I get a Quick cash or no ok just breathe through it ok dislike
what do you call suppose if you want to deploy some code some it is a secured environment where you can store your details ok so it again so very big topic team so so high level I'll give you
so that you can think imagine of it imagine what it is just imagine it is a like a secure suppose you are you want to run an instance of Apache Apache server normally what you do is that Apache Spark Tomcat and Apache server supports if you want to host the service Tomcat Apache server
so what you do is normally you install server ok you install a machine and then deploy some components and top of it you do instead of that what you can do is in your same machine water machine you have you can create something like a trusted environment and add only this instance ok it'll have one it won't have all other components if you have only Tomcat Apache server and related components OK nothing more than that
find this is a container ok so like this you know instead of Tomcat Apache can help chaincode ok so why it is secured whole another topic No trying spend spend some time and find out like you know what is the docker container health in terms of security and stuff like that fine so the next platformers sawtooth
sawtooth Lake to diesel very I'll give a very brief introduction and then we'll move on Ok for class is mainly focus on fabric Shailendra do we need to learn docker not required so high level just find out like for fabric it's not required but all you need to knows what is this docker container and how it is going to protect my fabric environment ok like in terms of chaincode so sad to play kiss
hyperledger project under a false and hyperledger this project mean this is like most of it is developed by Intel ok and they used algorithm proof of elapsed time in on the class 2 what we look at this link know how that works we look that what is trusted execution environment what is SGX ok so all this principle sir take in here and there trying to build a platform people claim that sawtooth late could you know
boutique fabric ok so many news like that we don't know it it's very early stages because if you look at fabric fabric has a problem in terms of order ok so everything goes to order and order I sent back to peer ok so this is enough even though it is kinda scalable solutions stuff like that this is a big bottleneck which fabric is trying to solve
ok so this is about it so to click and so we look that this proof of work algorithm minimum trusted execution environment and SGX ride so all those things makes in a thought to click different hyperledger India hyperledger India is a day work on identity platform ok today if you look at ntp platforms there are platforms like hyperledger Indies 1 p.m.
platform there is something call sovereign yes movie Aryan ok sovereign there is something called Civic there something called you put ok so these are digital identity platforms ok which runs on top of blockchain when it comes to blockchain that there are three types OK what is digital identity based platforms what is
blockchain itself instead of saying digital identity it's a distributed identity card distributed identity management distributed ledger distributed storage ok so distributed ledger we are looking at Atrium Bitcoin and fabric
fabric saltlake all this comes under distributed ledger distributed identity here comes sovereign Civic Indi Indi sovereign Civic all this comes under distributed storage IPF us from all this comes under distributed storage there is something call
Chindi be ok so if you are into development right so all these will have to utilise especially even distributed identity is fine ok distributed ledger and storage and no one has to know so what is the use of distributed management identity and what is that this going to solve ticket this ok so
what happens today is distributed in ATL give a simple example okay suppose you go to that Steak and taking example as suppose you go to Bank of America today ok what do you do if you want to open a bank account OK what they ask they ask in Hella lot of details I'll ask your SSN they'll ask you where your address your ill ask your driving
all the stuff right you give them all all of it and then now for some reason you want to go to a different Bank ok supposed JP Morgan Chase Bank you want to know ok so now again what day do they don't take your details from Bank of America what they do they take all the details again from you like yours is an address everything you love to give then give the again the same details and
when you'll have to when did and then open an account ok but if you see here so you are giving your driving licence and SSN to Bank of America you trust Bank of America that your identity there won't be any identity theft them you know they make sure that they don't steal your documents and stuff like that ok it's just failure trust but I really who issues this details okay gone mad right so for example Government of India
issues Aadhar and PAN ok we have something another Pan right and Arpan ok and similarly in a USA issues SSN driving licence stuff like that ok so now what will happen is the next is what their thinking is and I don't want to going to algorithms and stuff like that that again Complex topic so Government of India will issue you and other and other
send whatever it is on top of that they will give you a hash value some random number ok so Government of India owns that you know they have issued your other they will give you a hashcode ok as code for those Aadhar so now if you go to Bank of America Uni not produce your other okay Aadhar your SSN the real detail you can produce the hash using this has they can verify that whether you have given the right has whether you are the right person and stay
ok so what happens if it's very easy it solve the identity is distributed ok now if JP Morgan wants to verified ok they can verify from the blockchain instead of get a physical copy of it and the beauty of it is you are just going to give a hash to them ok some has number to them but still they will be able to validate whether you are your morning that are not ok so beautiful you are not giving your session but still
you are getting validated that yes I have you know I am the ownership of that is ok so that is the that is a good distributed identity so question from silent what'll happen in case list of documents very for everything will get hash ok but the concept is the same supposed Bank of
India has three it seems JP Morgan will have to that's fine you know if JP Morgan has only two right so if they want suppose they don't want you driving they want your only a tree driving licence and suppose they want your state ID card for some reason ok so you are not going to give your directly your not going to produce a physical identity insert your will be producing a mask identity like a hash JP Morgan will be
able to query from blockchain and find out like whether you are the ownership of that particular count particular driving licence or state ID make sense some if you look at some platforms read the completely work in digital entities are some companies in company is awesome projects customer required only reason lengthy platforms that so that
about it so here you see this is a important word no one wants it everyone can use it that's right the Shailendra so for each of the items operate has will be issued that's right yeah and so that is again depends upon you know the type of platform whether you use India weather used Civic sovereign each one have a different mechanism one has a multiple
Prakash ok fine to the next one is hyperledger Boro Boro is again a neighbour bro is a project what they've done is there were taken the ethereum in a day period source code and their Dinner Fork of it and they what they want to do if they want to remove this proof of work algorithm ok and they have something called proof of stake tendermint consensus they want to build this consensus and then they want to release
so this is hyperledger borrow project fine now let's take a quick 5 minute break after that what we're going to Lucas will basically touch base on what are the tools we have with hyperledger fabric and will do some practicals ok 96 problem meet at 9 12%
floating I hope all of your back
details you can set up in high progesterone then you can deploy it so it is more of a administrative perspective hyperledger Cello used used in excel compressor explosion Explorer Explorer is like you know how we look at the blockchain dot info etherscan.io right similarly have something call hyperledger Explorer it will help you to find out like what else what are all the transactions which have happened in the network that's about hyperledger explore
ok make sense Jason hyperledger dot org is official website that's right yeah I don't know whether it is worth it give me a minute yeah that's right
the 3 Jason can you please repeat ok see seller's for deploying the network ok so deployment if you wanted deployed in a cloud how many missions are there if you want to terminate the entire blockchain if you want to start the network ok so that's where hyperledger Cello is used more of an administrative tool Explorer
is equivalent to what we look at here right blockchain that info so when you look at blockchain dot info this is a Explorer blockchain Explorer right Bitcoin Explorer so you know like what all blocks are there what are what were the transaction said that so this is blockchain for a bitcoin world for either or did you have something to eat ask and daughter you right so these are the ones so likewise here you have hyperledger Explorer
look at the blocks okay and I'm hyperledger composer it it it allows you to easily define business networking business Network and you can make transactions in today's class we will look at the practicals of it you will get to know hyperledger composer these are the tools that's what in hyperledger Cello what are mentioned blockchain as a service platform suppose if you want to go to IBM bluemix and
what type of nodes what should be the configuration where it has to be hosted all those details can be selected and diploid apologists hello ok so the next one Explorer have told you like and what is the blocks transactions 10 codes all the other detail details you can see nhai project explorer in this Explorer window
so hyperledger composer that is what we are going to see it is a previously there was nothing call hyperledger composer when there was no hyperledger composer all we can do is a right same code deploy that in any event the deployment was harder so you go to appear deploy the chain code and also the chain code has to be written only on
language and then you have to deploy can make all the transactions against ok so composer how it helps us you can be find your network definitions in a more of a drag and drop easy to write feature ok and then you can initiate transaction so out of it OK it is pretty much it pretty much does the same thing what chaincode does OK but in a more you know as a user perspective it is very easy to write chain code and deploy
mixins and once this hyperledger today we will be defining a network and deploy Kitna fabric environment so after that one suppose if you deployed and from you if you want to retrieve those details and display in the UAE ok you have fabric composer ap is 40 and using that you can display the details what is happening with the transaction what is happening to the business network all those details you can fetch it
Ganesha hyperledger composer used for composer only when we look at practical rate you'll get to know what it is benefits of composer like previously what happened everyone should know go language to write code to write a chain code but today in or at least you should know some languages to write chaincode but today if with the help of composer even if you don't know
language in a basic edition know JavaScript JavaScript and simple Syntax would help you defining and the entire business letter definition so complete thing you can do it with help of composer make sense it is very good abstraction layer like you dont know Nimmi not know like what is happening in the chain code level how do you create a set no need
use low level APS said it is like a more of a configuration and then deploying it so if you look at what are the tools that uses one is the first one is data modelling that is you can be find your assets peers what are the commodity you are trying to trade with ok all those details Vikatan model it where I see if you suppose just imagine in the case of ethereum gold
Usain Bolt what you have to do suppose you're trying to create a movie cell project right so we'll have to write structure this is my movie this is my details the mappings all those you will have to code right here it is more of a so if you want a movie cell project all we can do this you can okay this these are these are going to be my feels you can just model it so that is state and definition and for executing a transaction against your assets or participants or something
JavaScript you can use JavaScript and Visual Studio code and atom diesel popular development platforms they both have plugins so you are Syntax and everything gets high rated there and with playground so there is something call composer playground will look at that so so it is easy to develop a composer voter ID list picking composer composer works fine ok
underlying all all those things creating business network coverage in everything composer this but the UI for it is called play playground ok score composer playground and a web playground or so that's about it and its all run through node node ap is are there integration is easy okay node JS API is are there too if you want to push this with playground will help you to create using the playground you I was suppose if you won't have a car
you I can you upload node libraries for it not another integration platforms typically JSON based should be easy to integrate then the so what happens water business tattoo definition you generate then when you deployed what happens this you would be used an internal it will generate automatic code so that it can interact with Fabric in mind but this or that which uses used by the composed question
ok so Now instead of going through theory will go to practical and then probly will come back here so all of you what I want you to do is let me know if you have any questions or answer before we didn't practicals so what we are going to do was ok let me quickly tell you like ok so we are going to open
we are going to open a composer playground ok and then we are going to make a transaction and test and make sure that it is working that is what we will see today for that what I want you to do is go to module 7 and go to the practical file Kanda persentation ya something or practical file and download this file and keep it ready
English good question Gayatri does hyperledger allow any attachments in case of our attachments you'll have to you can use IP office from here I mention right so ipfm Bechain DB like you can use these elements to store the documents
mixins so all of you let me know if you have all downloaded and your get ready to test
it is completely possible regarding so combination of fabric bow the different completely different tools if it is possible to integrate not wrong so what others all of your ready can get a Quick yes or no
yes ok so good yes so if you have this document it's pretty much straight forward you know we went to follow the document ok so there is nothing new there but I'll tell you like why we are doing it
so now what we will do this all of you ride once you
accounts open composer playground it vidmate so it is going to open a composer playground right click and open whatever we need this document and if you look at here
there is a thing called get local version right local version will be totally different when it's the one and the same but here what we are trying to do today is we will try to do a simple one simple one that is like a simulator like how we use testrpc red Shimla thing will do today
give me give me a second grace
song of you right you should be saying something like a deploy a new business network ok so all of you can you see it ok so this is deploy a new business network Sudhir is getting some
it's not be from it looks like you have used in older version of composer playground before you know even while you open your getting an error what happens
ok Sudhir let me just give you instructions and then I'll take your machine ok just give me a minute ok so others team what will have to do is right if you click on this ok as soon as you click here to play on business network Oggy can find out
there are many different networks so these are nothing but is IBM more min the fabric network itself as have developed some of the networks ok so now we are going to create a brand new ok so lets leave all this create a empty business network is what we're going to do ok so can you all just for
this documents for a while just try to do this as a file ok in the meantime let me go in a find out what is happening with Sudhir machine just give me a sec can I take a remote of your machine Sudhir
finish your trying right so what I want you to try is in a do not go till 8. You stop ok not beyond it or not beyond 8 year
what it says this what is composer playground my bluemix.net for slash Login ok press into mark that's ok that's ok close this window
yeah that's ok think also there should not be a problem try to create a deploy click and deploy select the same MT business network
yeah for now just ignore I don't know if it's going to cause a problem while we deploy but for now try to follow it thanks thank you ok so so I didn't say some question 16
quickly tell you like y'all able to see my screen Veera minute now you should be able to see my screen
ok so do you have some questions let me tell you like to know first what we're trying to do ok so first in the other networks what you say read this basic sample these are all developed by IBM and others so for simple testing purpose so lets leave that we are going to create a empty business network so that's what we're going to do OK so the first one so now after that
are we good tell here all of you yes ok Sweet insurance for just hold a while ok so now after doing this right so it will ask you to we are in step 3 ok once this is done in step
it is asking you to create the files right so we have to create 4 different files look at here so fabric network right it contains this it requires these 4 files are infinite this 3 files is enough please Fear Files has is required for a successful business network one is called model file script file access control file
ok step 3 ride just give me a minute ok so it's all we have 2 mins
the following you so that sunao will connect now have deployed and we are here now if you look at here we see like about there is a model file that is access control file so we'll have to create some files here already we have a model city on permissions not a selfie ok whatever contents edureka has given so that we are going to copy paste here so the first used to add a model file model file we already have it ok
locate in the composer there is already model datesheet you so not a problem just click on this model.com place copy this content and save it there in the model file make sense Shailendra Dennis are we good
ok step 3 completed now step step for right step for it is nothing but adding a model file if you go here you can see that under in Under the Dome I left you can see that about model file access control file click on this model file
ok and copy paste the contents what you have what is provided by edureka ok Canada did you get it so the next one is step 5 steps I will have to copy this stuff
and place it under I know you will have to create a new file there is no file called this JS what is that file called that we don't have a script file so what we let's do it as a file so we'll select script.js ok hope all are following me click on ad and hear you copy paste the script contents make sense
how to save and I think its autosave so no worries you just move on to a different tab I think it will be saved OK so the next one is adding the access control file
OK so the next one is copying the access control related information ok so where is your access control here to copy paste here
sorry all good to hear ok good good so before we deploy I'll give a quick note like you know why we are doing this what it is all about your mind update but they deploy change maybe because of the version should not be a problem
ok sir give a quick note about what this is all about ok so when you look at here ok first what we look that is let me quickly got over during ok so that you know that you know it is a different we're using different tools set to develop the stuff right here Oneness one is data
modelling right so this is nothing but this model file data modelling file here we define what is going to be our asset asset asset commodity identified by another this is what does it is suppose if you want to create a set of say you want to create a currency asset for example so you can create that here suppose if you want to create sometime back I think he was mentioning about I want to give give some reward point
thanks to my folks were working my team ok see you are good you can create asset and reward points and we can create that ok make sense so this is about it and okay won the first one first line says namespace namespace is so for example it is our date IBM you will be having a namespace ride in IBM there is a blockchain department so you you can
send your own namespace who who should access these details and who what is relevant for this name space so that is what you are going to defend and so you are defining acid first piece is your defining an asset asset can be anything ok if you want to define a asset like a vehicle okay just imagine what all vehicle can contain it can contain a Vin number ok if you can conduct series number
I can contain a model model of the vehicle vehicle details so lot of things you can contain so this is this is about the Asset ok and the next one is who is going to trade this is it ok you are created a vehicle is it ok who's going to trade the sunset trader going to use this is it suppose a dealer okay Honda dealer has created asset call Honda cars different types of Honda cars like se Honda Honda Civic Honda CR
we are we are we a lot of things are the right reasons for being created ok so that is the first 30 second one is who's going to trade for for someone to trade what are the details are required ok so that is this one you are so for every customer care be something for customer ID right so like was here there something called traded you setting it here ok and what is that he is going to trade
is that is what is mentioned here so fukin let me come to you when you are facing camera let me come to you just give me sick so these are the details ok so this is about the model file your modeling your network what is going to be rested who are going to be your participants what is that you are going to achieve OK so the next one the script file so this file
this is pretty a JavaScript file to this defines your business logic so what you're saying is if you won't hear what we're going to do is a simple trade is going to happen if one is going to trade I suppose a car and asset it is going to change ownership from one person to another person ok so far this is a simple JavaScript how many of you do not or how many of you know JavaScript
remember Shailendra once said that he knows JavaScript I don't know what others OK so the third one if you look at the access control piece Jason knows ok fine so if you want to use the composer if you want to the composer approach then you'll have to know JavaScript ok so just do some pressure. JavaScript in fact our classes
edureka class itself as a blockchain as a prerequisite class JavaScript ok you can take that ok so this the third one is access control so here you can be fine like who all can access OK Here first one is system related hear what you're saying is action allow like ways you can say suppose if you want to define only read action you can mention that this can be read this can be
write likewise you can mention different types of action here ok for now what we are doing is we are going all permissions anybody under this namespace or get me my network dot star anybody under this network alive everything ok and anybody under this this is system defined so this also we give all permissions
Suzuki Ritz compose a composer like this all Aditi Browser version to write code that is more than that okay in solidity even if you write code OK your just limited to write code from yes you can reply also get right couldn't reply but here you can be find the entire network in solidity you can you love to define who are your participants are going to you have to write a structure all the stuff this is more of like you create entire business letter
definition so this is about it and you know what I want you to try next is after adding this try to do a deploy let me work with whom Khan and see you know why I think for some of you there is update thing for me and there is deployed changes that's because of the version not a problem in you click on it ok and just be in the test environment let me finish with whom can and I'll be right back
home can I take your machine as remote hello
who can let me know so I can take remote of your machine so probly right from the error what I see is probly that there is a copy paste mistake or something that wait a minute let me take ok so yeah you try to fix it if not possible in just copy paste the contents should work
ok next us we are going to test the business network once you deploy the changes ok I want you to do it deploy changes ok taking a while
ok so after deploy changes then click on test tab ok and click on all transactions so internally right so internally what has happened is when you created this files when you click on deploy changes always where deployed all these were right type of transaction this
system related transactions ok because if you want to add a participant if you want to add a site if you want add a commodity everything is a transaction for hyperledger fabric ok so all those details goes as gonna say transaction but we don't realise it ok
ok guys are we good tell here sorry all able to see the transaction now if you are good click on so there are different things right participants commodity and click on trader ok so click on tree
and then what you are going to do this you are going to create different participants ok so under this or that mean under this namespace your creating something called a trader ok and you are trying to create two different participants ok can you follow this all what we're going to do is we are going to copy paste the stuff here
some going to taste it and create new ok Jason is not getting trader option so what option you get Jason how about others others are you getting trader option
yep probably we know why did you guys press the deploy button so what you should have done this once you define all these details right we do minute so if you if you go to your my business network ok and connect so here
so ok just go to define and click on deploy changes again once you click on deploy changes it should get greyed out like this then you're hittin test you should see this details can you give it a try you can't define and find out whether this is been deployed
she will add one more participant so let me know if you are still if you are not able to get it let me know let me log into your machine remote your machine find out
ok ok you keep adding at think quotation and soon colours having some difficult let me find out ok so I need to take your machine remotely just give me a second
JSON embed have requested media se presenta just and unjust show me like you know what's going on Let me find out Shailendra maybe some copy paste issue then there is nothing special in there try to do it again
Hardy Sandhu yes I can hear what you have said this only thing is that can you delete one can you delete the sample right click on it
recycle bin button right on the right hand side on the right side ok ok so there is one more thing also
so this also I'll have to delete this is the script file descriptor also write permissions to TCL let's make sure that you have the right right contents in there this fine with our one thing now it should be fine good and
so might have to go to test ok do one thing ok the right click on this in there is a dropdown admin right can you click on that are not do anything
not required okay hear from 0.012 there is 0.2.3 right can you change it to 0.2.4 yes I'm edited and give different 2.4 deployed see what happens your kids don't go to test still you are not able to see
interesting ok no problem what had happened is since there were two files right so click on dropdown admin go to my my business network ok so what I would recommend this delete both of it there is a recycle I can write so delete both of it
let's try to read out OK got it should try to do that in the meantime let me space with phone karna
so soon can I am going to take your machine hello hi OK so
I Am A Disco screen now is it is also can you go in account define ok so let me find out what is your click on script file also fine
sample disease or can you click on the model file everything seems to be right ok can you click on the dropdown find out what is minus my business network clickonnet
Telugu setting to both of you and Jason almost I don't know why I have this can you do one thing can you try and recreate it just delete both of it and try to recreate and see like and if it's happening again ok so I just delete this sorry
Yeah let me know ok so try it and let me know thanks thank you ok team so rest of you were you all able to create 2 participants
so if you had created the participants the next to staples you'll have to create a commodity so how do you create a commodity in a click on this commodity create new asset ok and copy paste the stuff what during has given
ok ok done nothing Gayatri is complete Shailendra completed
so here you see you are defending like what is your participant I know it's going to be a trader on high level it's going to be trade and Defined by trade id now if you go to test and if you click on this trader so that's what you're doing it ok so that's why it shows you trader here and I said to just us commodity okay soundar this what you are saying
this is going to be under my network or at me my network cannot read or whatever it is what all field theory on rights of those fields we are giving it here similarly in commodity also ok so right now in commodity additionally what you are doing is your defining the fields what is the commodity all about UK hear that reading symbol is ABC something on top of it your assigning owner also so this is mine
speak and under this namespace there is a trader and this is a way you could define it ok if it says trader one here your saying I like that read it is trade 13.1 ok are we good tell here have you created commodity trader Jason and Sukant were you able to find it or still
having issues related Cuba like a couple of minutes for them to get it done both phone karne and Jason just can I get a Quick
no
ok so Dennis the menace is done
so Jason and phone can can I get a quicker so now where you are right now
at step 5 ok fine let's give another minutes
ok
ok so so who are who have completed right so after creating this so the next steps are ok will have to click on now you know what I want you to know donna's click on the commodity in the commodity
now the commodity the trading symbol rate this commodity is owned by trader one right you see here it is won't be trader one now you are going to clear click on submit transaction ok wait I'm ready follow this I don't want to find
answer me transaction and select the trade button ok so what I'm going to do a click the submit transaction and by default selected trade it so some other trade ok lets the copy paste this stuff so what we are trying to say here is so I want to trade on this commodity called ABC OK then you wanna is going to be paid to you can then submit
equal Sukanya after that make a transaction so click on transaction and we're copy pasted and then click on submit transaction ok now if we click on the commodity see what has happened from trader one it has gone to try
ok so when we look at all transactions so that we have added participant so that was awarded Jones someone right so then we had another participant then we had a commodity then finally we traded between them ok so that is so the others all things are have happened here where we all able to complete till here
can I get a Quick yes or no so can I don't know where you are right now but ok if you had completed till this can you tell me the step number where you are and right now
step 9 ok so give me a minute so step 9689 what we're trying to do is we are trying to create two different participants ok under this namespace Ragni network ok we're trying to create two participants trader what is Jenny Jones the other one is Amy William Williams we're trying to create this ok so click on the test button
Nokia and click on this trader create new participant and copy paste the first one create new and then again click on create new participant and create another one similarly do it for commodity also
ok ok so after click on submit transaction what is happening ok so what happens is after click
then we establish to trade between two different parties so that's what we have done so if you have complete let's take five minute break probly like will let us all meet at 10:15 ok like a phone can others like having some issues how I can help them out ok so this let me know if you have any questions or after the break
Rakesh did you get it
Naukri
that's why
ok didn't so we will have a ball of your back so where all of you able to send a transaction and find out that they know the trade has been in a from a trader one the ownership has been assigned to trader to very all able to notice it can I get a Quick yes or no
different types of transactions all can be categorised and stored here so that is the video of it so now if you let us compare like what we have done in this couple of slides ok so what does we define the business network ok so so how we define is nothing between am and we provide a version of it and then small description and these are the three main files which country
network model file restart city of file ECL file that is access permission Telugu can access what and the last one is a transaction from JavaScript file in all these three constitutes it so now if you go to your hyperledger composer and when you click on if you are in test ok just in the top right hand corner there is a row then if you click on this my business
works you can find out that we have now created whatever we have created and tester tester tried so that business network is available for you this want part of it ok so the other one is so this is what was constituted this consider all this details so next one how it works and how it operates so so we define two things here one be defined what is going to be a commodity you're going to be here
traders what is the Asset level permissions to do that is all define and then what we are doing his mail is JavaScript what it has to do with the defined disturb ok so that is a JavaScript part then you deploy it ok now what happens together your entire business network definition plus whatever you have in array JavaScript all those has been deployed as a smart contract ok so this just a local version it's not really
meaning of fabric environment but this what if you do that the same thing you can achieve whatever you try to do locally you can do the same thing in the fabric and my medicine know what is really happening if you see ok so like how this can be utilised that is you can deploy this network ok you can select you can mention like who are going to be your participants what is your network models
call II develop and then you can deploy without making any transaction then what you can use this service client SDK SAP is available suppose you are developing this client application suppose you are developing 14 manufacturer then what what can happen if you can send a transaction suppose manufacture wants to send some details like he has purchased the car you can from the dropdown he can select a car then then do I submit or something like that so that can be recorded as a transaction
UI and shoot sometime back we look that MVC type of architecture right module sorry model-view-controller logic so so the view like the your the one you are going to develop so internal it will work with the business network definition whatever we have created ok so thats thats about it and so the rest is salt
articles what we have seen so any questions solve this read the rest of the slides is what we have looked that in the in terms of practical sub Download the practical file and we have taken look at it so question from Gayatri how to expose hyperledger to external application through API ok so good
location is like ok fine I have deployed these this network's is fine LOL fine ok how do I deploy ok so what will happen is ultimately composer there are different ways you can do it so suppose you're going to use composer let's say
so there are HD case available ok so you like a library is available basically JavaScript libraries and other things available using that you can interact from your application so that's what I meant how to win
Shin from JSON to this is the IBM bluemix product right so it is part of IBM bluemix ok I have not use IBM bluemix it is part of IBM bluemix I believe they are posted because it's ibms ok but it is a separate one like in a composer playground is created and their integrated with IBM bluemix doesn't make sense Jason
Gayatri is there any step by step process document for this side Dino Gayatri let me in there I have seen some couple of blocks very can try to connect IBM has a documentation ok but that is also not a step-by-step direct documentation ok they are given a step-by-step documentation using commandline Ok how do you interact with command line but from UI using API
Dev not provided one Let me find out if there is a blog or something let me share it with you in the group next how to create a lot at me my network not read
you know what does it mean I didn't I didn't get the question no no ok I got it so I think you are asking about the name namespace' like a package right if you are from Java world I believe like your asking about the package structure how do I create how do I used it right ok so do not confused with that ok it is more of a in terms of urbanization perspective for example let's take honda.com ok
lipstick under honda.com are there a lot of cars so for those cards can create a namespace and work with it okay in your compare directly with what do you define as sir Java package structure and this one okay how to create namespace like I know what we have done right or not at me dot whatever is your name space what is that your following it near organ
station okay typically what happens is I'll give you another example so so any organisation if u look you will be following this ldap access or something like that will be active directory access with an organisation I'm saying right so suppose managers will have some access so some managers would have other access to their access to some resources wise
awesome access correct so even this ldap can be we can configure ldap together and then accordingly define our business network you are getting it the namespace I'm not meaning that it's not a java package related ok so any questions before we move on to the next chapter
that's why Shailendra ok so fine so let me let solve onto the next one so next class is also like you know when you look at the practical it is pretty much the same but we will do din the Unix environment instead of
just give me a second guys
ok so what we're going to do here is almost the same business network repetition is what we're going to do here but we instead of doing it through you I will do using this through some command lines will be executed some commands and will be doing it ok so for this also what I want you to do this lets but download this practical file
ok self quickly tell you like what we are going to do give me a minute
ok so what we're going to do is which which practical file is this modulate that's right modulate so here if you look at hyperledger composer playground OK what you do what you can see is there is a deploy business network right here there is a option you can drop
let me open all of you open your virtual machine the previously when it is a local so even we could have tried from
hello yes ok fine so the next step is I hope all of you have completed till this step right my network step
ok so Dennis where are you able to follow you are not able to copy
sudanese is not able to copy How about others are you all able to copy and download the sample network ok fine so the next step was right next step look for Visual Studio code ok so in the
start button if you see here you can see Visual Studio code ok open that so once you open your click on the open folder and try to open the file I'll go open folder so hear what I am going to do this in homemade yureka is where we have stored
this my network and click on Ok package JSON not the full file Shailendra only the portion of it so Mallika something is not right for me can you take a remote of your machine let me know
trichology Shailendra food
does not work then probly what I would do you know recreate that GIT clone again if so what is not ready let's see so you are able to get long that's fine this done that's right type palaspe siphon ltr
Somalia can you type LS space iPhone ltr life and ltr LS ifn ltr with space LS followed by space
download you are good to go you have my network right now what you will have to do so open Visual Studio code the left hand pain you can see right now open folder on open folder
did yureka my network yeah ok if I tried to follow so all of your dinner so were you able to complete
ok good fine so now what we're going to do is so we're taking a different approach now previously what we have done is locally be created business network definition and diploid now we are taking a business that you're definition and then we are changing some stuff ok so now I hope all of you have opened your folder ok now here UK
find out that there is something call package that Jason ok so here is where you define what is your name of your network so the first one says like you can say commodity network whatever you want and you can define your own version and description ok basically so below details in address more of how how it's going to work so let us not change all these so if you
you know what we are trying to do is we are going to change only this portion of it ok so carefully Notun from name to this portion ok so just copy paste this stuff so we are not doing anything fancy so what we are trying to do is so we are just changing the name of it like what is this network name is called my network your pain to change this is a my commodity network ok
and doesn't this name has changed as my network accordingly the commands also change here so only that we are went to change Ok so let's copy it
select copy this and from name till this braces ok so I can show you side by side also if you see here Seene Me has changed version we have changed
buffet show the image and other things stay the same and probly the command name we have changed because we are using a different network name so rest of it is all Saint Louis the one we have copied
she probly you know since its in next line I got an error just moving to the previous line ok are we good tell here
ok now listen the next one is very minute I don't know why it's so this is done and now the readme file also we are changing it read me
just changing it to some name ok so that's ok so this is all some some stuff ok we can change it to my network or something like that don't worry about it some is your thing what we are concerned here is our model file our lips file our featured at the end
sample to JS model file these are the ones we are Kadam in Academy right now ok and there are some permissions not a serial ok now what I wanted to do was same t what we have done the right it is the same trading symbol same network what we have done there just copy this this portion of it this is a model portion of it model portion you try to copy and once you copy copy paste it in
model the sample receipt your location so copied
in fact there is a vs plugin here and I want to install up again plugin you can look at the syntax also can I think you are facing in host issue again ok or try browsing from your VM so if you are not able to then there is some DNS issue as you mentioned last thing
Kishore is just I'll show you this there is a selection ok so now its not required a little later. We'll see ya full and a sample but CPU under completely update OK so the model file the remaining files also has to be updated Asus next is going to be a commodity sorry your asset
ok so here is a sample that JS so same commands get same commands what we used in UAE same thing we are doing it in the Visual Studio code but it's better to do the other way around because you know in the UAE
so easy to do you know what you are doing so this is sample so what is the next one next one is permissions will probly this is a permissions file copied the permissions file come see if here there is a sample under model sample dots CTS change sample node JS is changed now permissions not ECL so controlling it's like a fully replace it
ok phone can suppose if you are not able to follow no worries you know we have done the same thing whatever you have done it locally right so we're trying to do it here tried to follow and probably once at the end of the class try to get in touch with edureka Team 12 and find out let me know what is going on with your machine ok so
so this three things are changed now are we all good to hear Ya full change sample that cd of full change permissions not that a shell file is full change JS is also full change yeah I am and I am not going to proceed until you guys all have coffee till here
yeah I can show you are so this is my vs paige OK what all I've done is have changed 4 files to get the first one is the package that Jason I change the first person between this name and this braces ok this one I've changed so the next one Broadway I have done is have changed this model file so my model
all 4 5 6 Updater are we good to hear ok showing some error in package to Jason so probably I think alike what are your copy paste a right so so there is something wrong
ok can you change it Mallika so here can you take a look like what what has been changed stepper just give me a second Jason so let others also complete
so others who have completed ride so what I want you to do it so let's do CD my network that is we are getting whatever network we have created right so here being here what we are doing is where doing npm install ok and hit
it'll take a while so the meaning while Mallika were you able to change it so that should be a probably a braces are some pretty small stuff let me know if you are not able to find ok let me take your machine remote of your machine
can you share your screen ok can you scrollable
engines 16 give me a second I am trying to find out just give me a second from name before repository that should be before posting
test getting failed to parse JSON just give me a minute Shailendra
so that should be a source ok is that a problem ok bye in the free play in the pre publish right before source type right
can you give me access quickly so the line number 11 or ok first of all right in the name C name there is a problem so ke name colon my network I fun and that
one should have quotes double quotes ok and just remove that space between iPhone and stuff I dunno yeah and the below line also version also should be double coated I don't know how come you lost all the double quotes
some reason while copy pasted it has lost all the double quotes that's why is an issue problem can you add a real quick double quotes on another Reliance also likely not starting my and network image ok so try to correct that no ones then be ok
and also there should not be any space between the 11th line ok iPhone iPhone space so stay what's not be that way it should be iPhone iPhone without a space so similarly for source name also to change add double quotes for the rest of the lines ok so gaye is very old able to install
so we have were just 5 minutes left how many of you can extend the class or let me know
see if it's getting late for you then probly will have to look at it tomorrow so I definitely it's going to take another 1520 minutes can I get a Quick yes or no from others all of you
ok so Mallika now yours looks good so far npm install doesn't work so no issues right extend ok so we'll try to finish this fine thank you
so for all of you right did npm succeeded or did you feel that for me also does failed how about others not
Dev installed in p.m. in the right way okay so there is so ok fine again the problem was so there is a iPhone iPhone space right when we copied in the package tour Jason there is a problem for me you know I don't know about
so if that's the case can you try to adjust that and again 2 npm install Shailendra what area did you get what is your problem
ok now it worked space issue it was ok fine so all of you have you completed till here
basically what this is done ok other side believe like Dennis Rakesh Lavika Subhashree I hope your all following it Jason so what what we have done till here is so this one we have did the npm install by default it created something called RK with created it created business network definition something called my
network.in it is created one OK so how do you check it type LS pe psiphon ltr you can find something called not here we have created an asset directory go to disk CD just ok so that is my network my iPhone network not be any OK got it so we have created RK of your network so that we can important in our machine in our
poster playground are we good to hear questions ok so now when you look at the document ok so what they've done is the next step is unit testing ok so I just let us keep this unit testing ok and directly step is unit testing a good escape for 9th 10th
till 11 we can skip all of it ok so already it was created probably we are trying to create one more I think ok so will create this business network definition again OK it is already created
hey let's try to do it again so what this should do is internal this is use this command only in package Road Jason this what we had So being in my network directory he left executed
so it's going to take another 15 minutes totally totally will spend 11:15 will find out what's the plan yes we are directly going to
Number 12 Sen. It is doing the same thing ok so if you have already have we don't have right now my see if you go to WhatsApp
Japanese inside serum if you go to dist folder of my network and if you type a lesson ltr you should see something like my network.in a to which was created just 2 minutes back when we did npm install this is what has done ok so what is this compose
doing rides in terms of practical what we're seeing his again it's more or less the same ok so here we have created something called composer archive create and then we are creating a b NFL right so what we did I am going to my Chrome Windows give me a minute and we go to this composer right so let me go to the old one be created so this is the old one I created
we all created so when we do export of this what I do what I get a Serbian if I'll just give me a minute showing folder so we get this empty business network dot DNA so this is what we get a ride the same thing is what we are trying to create in the Unix environment makes and suggestion
what what we are doing right now so we are creating Arcade of it ok so ultimately what you should do is there are other commands which we need to exit but that is not part of the practical OK I will show you like how the real-time Sinha is going to work ok so suppose you all can try this when you do a composer ok so what we're trying yes we have tried command
composer archive OK then I really what we should do is composer network ok so when you click composer network you find out all these commands deploy download ping reset start all the stuff ok once the business network is ready and your hyperledger fabric environment all the order Pierce everything is deployed
ready then the steps should be composer network deploy comes composer network start once you issue these tools commands OK your network will be all set up right now what we are doing is we are just shopping with the simulation part of it like a remix part of it okay like remix consider how to create a business network in fabric environment how to do it how do do I import so to that level only we are seeing in RC mentioned before fabric itself is a very big topic
it's like you know it will take at least like a twenty twenty four hours program to define everything so we are doing a shorter version of it got it guys so it's give me giving error for me let me take a look at it end of the line or white space ok so then there is a problem with permissions
TCL Shailendra probably have not copied it right or value copied some double quotes were not copied properly can you check again so Jason what's the error so probly I'll have to in a take your machine as remote give me a minute
before that right who has completed let me show that and then let others try the meantime I'll help you out so now what I'm going to do is composer playground ok so have clicked on this Jason just wait for a while
ok sir let's blockchain deploy business network what I do
instead of using our network like to know create empty business network what I do I do a browse ok and whatever we have created right now right and said fabric my network best I am importing it ok I am im putting it and then I do a deploy OK it is the same thing what we have done so now I do a connect ok so it by default it has all the files which
modified like before ok now all you can do is do a test you can do a test transaction submit transaction find out what we have done but again I repeat we are not directly connected to Fabric environment OK when we do a trader when we add participant it is not firing a transaction inside our blockchain environment ok so still we are trying to do it locally only hope you all get it
ok so in order to deploy it in the real time ok if you want to do that real time then the way is either we should use commands like composer network deploy composer network start or I should use a pic a pizza libraries to directly deploy to the network ok make sense
ok so Jason let me take your machine as remote to give me a minute father's Shailendra others team Mallika uniform can you having some difficulty Rakesh Lavika we all good yeah what is there you're getting so composer RK so you are in this network
if create a funny you are going to create a folder called used my network biennale is also write their life and source name actually source name there is a problem just give me a minute can you type composer RK space iPhone iPhone help
composer archive iPhone iPhone help enter ok so composer RK create iPhone iPhone help
ok source name the location to create the Arcade ok source type is directory that is fine name of the file ok so can you repeat the command command in just a few Prasanna you can yeah so source name try to give space give us ost
space no no no iPhone iPhone shows namespace speed dot / dist enter presenter this no search ok ok ok
again you press the back command will take that command and instead of inner just friend just give that alone source name just give out alone without anything enter so now it got created ok so prob
just not that don't copy this so got the NFL right so what is the next step was just import this be enough Island near composer playground ok and try to simulate whatever we have done in the previous think like creating participants sending a transaction ok creating commodity all the details how to import
so import right so so let me just walked Jason can you can you go to your Google Chrome and try it out composer playground vidmate I will show it
night C import what I am doing is in through my Chrome ok so I have opened this composer iPhone playground not bluemix.net ok so what it would do it it will open the composer playground ok so after
so what I do here is very dominant so I click on this deploy let me know delete this one so now what I click click and apply new business at work and then I hear you see you Shailendra on drop here to upload address click on this select this network definition be in a file and then do deploy
okay make sense and then connect now and do the follow the same step what we have done you know no need to copy the mirror copy change the details and all all will have to do is go ahead and directly tested ok create a new participant ok so all these things alone you try to follow the last day parade yeah so last year last step which
you mean Justin is it to the composer import into composer playground so what I do is so at the top right hand corner there is a dropdown click on my business networks and probly try to delete if you have something already ok now click on deploy a new business network then it will ask you whether you want it
existing network forest we need to use our business right click on browse and you can select this one which we have created select this and then Quikr deploy the reply button here click on deploy OK then after deployment so it is all deployed and ready to connect you can connect now now your all set now now what you have your b**** find out
so no need to define slides directly going to test if you want to add trader we can add this ok so these are LOL not pre-populated so we'll have to create traders commodities transactions and then we can send it make sense guys so its 11:15 right now so probly what we can do is give it a try so if you are not able to do it tomorrow / we'll see we'll spend some time
define don't like what difficulty walking through but in a try to finish it off and we have skipped this cucumber testing and other thing so it is all purely fully JavaScript testing unit testing Framework so that's why we have skipped that so it's not required actually ok fine so give it a try and about I am going to do it I am also going to upload this movie cell project ok
try to do a gunzip in a band directly don't try to unzip it probly Antar and then do a gunzip if it ok so it it is going to open it if you are facing any difficulties let me know will look at it tomorrow yeah that's good OK TV all good now
that's nice still in the others Mallika Jason all good fine thank you thank you didn't thank you all of you sorry
your feedback and thank you have all all of you have a good day
