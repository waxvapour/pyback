good morning team are you able to hear me the morning ok good good ok let's give another 5 minutes ok so I see very less participants yes let's give another 5 minutes for others to join
hey team I'm here and I when I see just 7 participants 79 participants
ok yes ya no still there are very less participants before the
7:40 ok
Kickass let's hold on you know we have very less participants and it is a programming class and others might feel left out so let's start at 8 only sorry about that guys we have a less participants like I can't help so but let me know if you have any questions I am happy to help
show the programming class will start exactly at 8 or default password for the VM it should be edureka
Mohit tissue looking for C + + code of Bitcoin rate you know some resources to understand the
this the one night
no prob
hitting
there is a class today and it's going to be at 8 o'clock sharp
KS good morning morning all of you sorry we couldn't start the class early enough
no problem we may need additional class so I am working on that to select she like you know how things are going to work ok they will have it before half an hour or we have one additional class so that we can cover up when you know whatever we are in a bit slow so we wanted to make up for it ok so good so today we will start with
programming solid it so quick recap on what we did yesterday so it yesterday it was all about the basics of ethereum in how blockchain blockchain what it as the important things where there is a currency called Ether in theory I'm ok you're carrying music currency
ETA and for every if a Turing complete language for every transaction in to make you need to send something called dash ok how the gas prices to me that we have looked at that and other concept be looked at is there something going to be oracles which is going to come in feature articles of coco Framework that is going to that be a game changer that is one thing we saw and we look that you know it's not just blockchain would help the ecosystem we need other things like
distributed storage distributed identity identity we have not looked into it yet but there is these are things together is going to in a build a good blockchain platform good blockchain ecosystem ok we look that it offers and swam that's about it and today's class your focus is on solid if the language for like first one and half hours to 2 hours like we look at the soldati terms of programming so can you all
quickly send me like you know chat window like you know what language you are familiar with enough you are new heroine can say that new to programming so that I will get an idea like you know where you are and when I site examples it will be good for me to choose I know C + + and Java so I can decide to see examples and you know anybody who is new intro to programming so it
sometimes you might feel like I know we are going fast or what we have to do that end of the class will have to look at the program oops concepts how does the it works OK then once on two to three times if you look at the class then you will be able to get it ok
ok C plus plus Mini a c plus plus I'll be good new to programming C Sharp programming COBOL YouTube showcase
C Sharp JavaScript Python ok ccplus West Jarvis Island Rajesh little bit of Java program vb.net ok fine we have a mix of everything looks like cplusplus is more compact to jawab ok so that's ok no problem
new where is New to programming in it will take a while to get it but for now I understand the concept ok ok good so I see what we have seen is solidity programming you how how to open this sir DT browser and what to do compilation all the stuff you look that ok so I hope you
all familiar with this to open this window 1 start typing in some code so quick introduction about what is this all DP ok sorry DP is the when you want to write smart contracts on top of ethereum platform solidity is the only language ok there was another thing called Haskell has closed another programming language but the widely used one is solidity OK so the contract has to be written in solidity but the contract if you want
call from outside ok so there are many libraries available JavaScript typical in node libraries are available in Java library Python libraries are available so that you can interface with smart contract ok that is possible fine so sorry didi is basic stuff it is a contract oriented language ok it follows also his contract is nothing but object oriented Right Here they say this contract oriented
ok so it has it is it is static statically typed meaning that when there are some programming languages like Python and all its dynamically typed JavaScript so what happens is by default when you assign a number to it ok it takes its other variable understands that I know I have practice number
ok or if its history in that case history but here it's not the way you know if it is a string you'll have to explicitly mention that it is a string variable and if its can't be integer variable you'll have to explicitly mention it so that is about static statically typed and it follows all UP concepts okay object oriented so you some of you if you knew I would recommend you not try this website's like tutorial point or something like that
do you know just get started with the object oriented programming ok so object oriented so this will give you high level ideas like object oriented principles ok so these are some of it like the inheritance encapsulation stuff like that
yep dog and I was asking strongly typed people called strongly type of statically typed and other at several ways people should also but it's one and the same the first one so next tues then I go by then I will go by the slides something if needs to be something at 8 I will stop in my laptop
show the first one if you enable default if you open it there will be a contract by default this comes in so if you look at this contract in the first line you can see pragma solidity ok so this is pragma direct it is nothing but it tells you when you write your program ok any program for that matter that it is a C program Ok Jarvis a different way if you write a C program you'll have to let know
that you know what is the compiler version attached to use on ok so here here what we are saying is when we say that greater than or MVC 0.4.0 this this particular code ok works with 0.4.0 or more than that there is backward compatibility solidworks so if enough for example if you want to work with the given quick
example suppose let's say that we have a string equals function this function was added in se 0.4.0 so 0.4.0 so you can use this
function from I know you up when you mentioned that 0.8 miles 0.40 it it will work ok but where as if you want to use fragment 0.3.8 for some reason your code will not compile because you know this function got added only in 0.4.2 but suppose if you want to use 0.4.1 5 ok still it would work the string equals would work ok so it supports back
compatibility in suppose they have changed let's say that in between version likes a 0.4 point 10 the change the name as a sphere = then what happens is normally what you do what happens if you get a warning message saying that this message this method is deprecated used other one so it is tattoo
minute tell the compiler that what version of fun what version it should get compiled ok make sense questions so this is about pragma directive ok so next one is this is importing other source files so it is nothing but if you use any programming language right so there are we cannot Run with
you know whatever could we are writing ok so be there would be a lot of dependencies we need to incorporate in our smart contract Orange Court whatever it is in Java what do you do in JAVA For example there is a way that he could import other shipments okay import suppose if you want to import libraries like some libraries like mathematical functions ok some library import ok so what do you do in C plus plus C plus plus audio
Judwaa hashing to distribute out it something like that so you include appropriate like this so similarly in think Python also there is something if you want to use this in a sum number doing some data science library you can include ok likewise here also you can include libraries using input statement this is a statement with Syntax and if you notice hear that
something called import star as symbol name from filename what is it supposed some experienced programmers that you might be knowing this but just bare with me like you know we have a mix of 300 going to some simple things also ok so for example if you look at here there is a match that his while so we were going to use mat for legs
ok here there is a variable called what can be called like like Global setting ok this is a variable ok so then what will happen is in your contract you have included on imported this month mat ok and then you want to use the same variable called Global City OK then what will happen is the Ranbir clash you are importing this match this has already got a global setting
and you are also trying to initiate the same variable in that case to why does the name clash that is something some concept call namespace okay namespace what is namespace I I will leave it to you so that we can explore more ok so but the idea is there won't be a class so here what we can do is we can give some so this is Nick and sem mathematics ok
define some name so when you want to refer the particular variable you should always refer this this is what you are doing is your just giving alias name for this entire month again so what happens if you can refer this variable using mathematics something in some names not like this ok so these are quick and robot namespace is and how do you deal with it ok so high level
what you should know if we can import other files and work ok ok so moving on so comparing between memory and storage in solidity so this is very important ok so what happens is paying more attention here to memory and storage ok
so what happens is being like coloured say that there is machine a machine B and machine see ok so you are all running a smart and the smart contract has been deployed that smart contract is here blockchain is there is a blockchain between ok all of you and there is a smart contract call like let's say that cause my contract got the ok to hear what happens is this is
smart contract is deployed ok now you will be this a contractor in sorry system they will all try to access some functions are values inside the smart contract by then sometimes what happens if you are trying to say that there is a variable called Ok kar wanna something like that ok
owner of owner of the car some kind of it is ok so what do you should do is whether whether it be a see once you deploy what happens it's all in the blockchain so whether it be a or b or C they should all have access to this variable so this owner of the car variable so typically these these variables will be all storage variables OK when we design the smart contract we should make
sure that you know these kind of variable should go into a storage location and some variable this is for masam manipulation awesome if you want to do some time calculation something like that then these variables go as memory variables okay make sense so in terms of keywords that is suppose if you want to create a variable call string X OK I will come in two variables ok a string X the only differentiation how
you should make us when you mention memory it becomes a memory variable that is a temporary variable and by default when you say string is it becomes a storage or you can say that string storage X ok either ways you can mention it make sense Shailendra owner of the car variables inside smart
that's right yeah that smart card so whatever very busy here talking about right it's all said smart contract variable hear it means will I am not in two variables I let me come that's the next topic so question from moving so the storage is like story on the blockchain that's right storage is like storing it in blockchain and memory is not typically you
why do some calculations and that minute that is dozer transient and once the execution is done in its not available to the next to your next node in blockchain if you look at the whole concept ride so you are trying to interact with the same thing right you are interacting with the same contract that is available for everybody okay supposing your contract let's say that you have a global variable called I ok
you incremented so here also this owner of the car should see that it has implemented same with the see also should see that it is implemented make sense so that is storage next movie on
what is memory again memory is memory is typically so memory what is memory Write some memories see you do something here suppose hear that is a variable called its ok this is called let's say that string X string memory X we have variable call dex ok you
do something here ok inside the smart contract deployed ok so this will not be available ok throughout the entire life cycle so it is only for a particular moment you do some calculation and then it goes away if you want to pursue something then you should go for storage Anand you can call it that way storage is that like you know something like a static or a global variable that
Satya both are residing in the contract yeah we are looking at how to write a contract so both the reason everything is residing in a contract nothing is outside so now no problem is not appropriate just kidding said she is memory variable stays till the end of the
program lifecycle know you know that is the main point it won't stay it is temporary ok so now we look at the different types of variables that are available for the smart contract ok so so there is heavy development going on in terms of solid it ok so whatever I am teaching you today in dinner may not be true even after 2 months so whatever I thought for
I think we were 4.18 previous batches now we are into 4.21 awesome ok Sweet keeps changing when I started blockchain and now almost the versions are like 10-11 versions have come up there when reduce lot of stuff ok so that I am also not able to keep pace of like what they are doing so there are lot of release notes will have to always keep checking and find out like what they had a newly
Sadar hai question so when you say smart contract is run on blockchain how does it work so blockchain is a distributed immutable database that's right Atrium is like that as well right correct so whatever transactions happened in whatever transaction happened in past are part of the blog where exactly would the smart contract would be stored in a block
that's right so if it is right morning see when we look at blockchain any blockchain for that matter ok it will all get stored inside a block all the transactions you are which are in which are fired against the smart contract everything would get stored inside a block ok and this blocks will be distributed to all the pear who are participating in the network make sense
yeah here also there opcodes ok question from Dennis and all the future block in the blockchain would have smart contract it doesn't he smart contract is a piece to blockchain suppose you want to use the ethereum only for
transacting between two parties okay suppose I have created a blockchain even let Sega private blockchain in your company and for some you have created some token called the X Y Z and you don't write any smart contract but all you do wish you know you send money transfers between 1:40 to another party we not have a smart contract at all ok so smart contract in a depends upon the business need ok
smart contract general it's not that enough we should always write a smart contract issue but it really is designed for it so question from Dennis is it correct to say that contract rules of contract rules are stored in memory and data will be stored in the storage no no Dennis like in the contract rules right so this entire smart control water
we are defining so that rules also gets stored in the storage for example let's say that here I'll make a condition like if if it is March 31st for example your transfer funds ok so this is my smart contract condition ok so that the contract says
ok even we approach March 31st transfer all the fun something like that we were mentioned in the country I can't keep this in memory ok so this will be part of storage only suppose hear what I do is inside the stanza funds I have like 10 variables ok like to wear inners some like wear temp temp today's date I have a variable call today's date
ok and we have like you wanted something like that ok and I use this for comparison and stuff like that ok so this becomes memory variable ok when I am but I'll have to explicitly mentioned as memory so this becomes memory variables ok but there really this if you look at this is Mark sorry for this condition itself is all
it is a smart contract itself so we can't say that rules are out of it rules are memory based so now we look at some of the basic variables what we have got so one is so many like integer it is signed integer you can have it from under when you're right
smart contracts it's very good that you try in I'm thinking as a low level programming and right because the reason being is more and more space you you know you occupy then you have to pay more gas fees ok so considering that will have to be efficient in writing smart contract so it goes on from end it OK it is like for 8 bit ok I am 16 and it goes up to
256 ok so these are integer variable so by default when you say and it becomes in 256 ok this all signed integer so there are other type of variable called you end so this is nothing but unsigned integer ok so you want also think it starts from 8 and it goes on up to you want to fix default when you say you went it becomes you and it is equal and to you win
256 ok and there is a variable called string and you have a variable called by it's ok. It's kind of a string but it's kind of a low low level
ok so we have string we have bites and we have erase sorisa all Complex type again there is basic type and complex typewriter Zaveri interview in string these are all basic and also I missed the Bull ok we have a Boolean variable which says which takes value is true or false so and there are you can create array out of it so you can see
you want to create array of think you can say into a of 10 so it means that there is a variable which is an array of type integer which takes and Canon M10 11th so what is the difference between unsigned intern normal and sons and didn't even take negative numbers you can't store -2 ok so it is not possible
but here in Hindi can store -2 that is supported and array array is like if you want to store more number of elements ok suppose you want to store 10 employee records are 10 employee numbers together ok so what you can do if you can story of instead of declaring 10 different variables like you and I equal to 10 you and be
220 like that instead of this what you can do it you can use arrays what will happen is a of zero becomes 10 ok of one becomes 20 and go in and it goes on make sense
bytes is a kind of a low level Jason so dislike care if you look at either Java C program okay internally when it it gets converted writes it solve by its ok let's write in a bit dragging topic for now will look at the basics and finally we will look into byte ok so and there are special variables ok so this is very important variable in terms of sorry
what is called address variable ok so this address variable holds like what is address X it it is a 20 bit storage thing is 20 bit so it can store your contact address suppose your contract address is 0x some number it can store that and some variables by default comes with attributes suppose if it is a array array is
Sandesh sarees attributes you can find out the length of it ok a doctor length ok can find out the size of the array like in any other programming language ok so similarly address has a property called you can find out like what is the balance what is the balance of this address okay export balance ok Sweet ill tell you like what is the balance of it so remember it so that is why we
Rebel 2 that is so if you look at either Scandinavia able to look at many balance weights we have address so this is an address you click cut the address your able to find the balance it right now it is zero 2002 this is what is used in internal showcase not balance balance is attribute to this variable UK or people call me now in JavaScript world is call attribute and here
can call this method ok so this is a special variable called address any questions that's right so question is so address data type is used to store the wallet public that's right ya
and there is one more function is called transfer OK will tell what is transfer also so there will be many functions ok we are just looking at games of it ok to the entire if you ask me to be a good sorry didi programmer should spend at least like a decent at least two to three weeks ok so in and out so we are just covering all those in couple of hours so just get a glimpse of it what is it and then you'll have to report
Grand effort to go deep into it what's it a read receipts a public that's right yes Dennis you are right ok do we have some books of solid EP no we don't but there are good enough get up get up early gives a good material or what
Sundari Thorium documents right so that itself is very good ok so we are not there it move it will see that ok so contract can have an address will a Contract contract can have a contract yesterday we saw two things right we saw
external owned account and contract ok both of it will have an address ok so here here the question is where that we are saying that address X equal to and this ok so this is what will happen is it whoever the current contract so that will becomes
this for here ok we will see that we are not there it fine then so how old you can make a represent strings you can have a double coat you can have a single quote ok and you like as in other programming languages if you want to have a tab inside string what we should do if you want to insert a line space what you'll have to do ok so these are some of it ok
ok make sense so some of the most of it will be so most of it right will fit into bytes ok so internet that's a good being worked upon so erase
Harish when it comes to erase again there are couple of things you can try with Harish one else you can have you know some languages used it is all categories you can't have dynamic array suppose you have 10 so it is starting error you fix the size ok and you can also do like this ok so this becomes dynamic array
read this becomes dynamic array so you will have to define the size during runtime OK when something is gets executed you mention the size ok so that's so both are available here ok and synthetically also like there are different ways you can declare an array so we can do it like this also we can do something like
you went your for 10 ok this is also possible ok so these are different types of Syntax what's all detail of you too but you can still if you don't like the syntax it's all fine you can used in a conventional ones
so when you declare dynamic array dynamic array as you know we discussed that erase have linked member so it has a like balance eraser you can insert a dot length and find out liquid it is similarly when you go for a dynamic array you have something called push ups for like pushing at the end of the suppose there is
you want a you want to put something and at end of it what you can do is a doubt push then it means like or something 11 some number you are trying to push so this is only possible with the dynamic array not with the static array make sense so quick claims like what you have seen we look that pragma so that defines the version of it and then we look that import ok like we know we can include other files
30 elected namespaces and different types of variables ok so now we are into array so in array in array again there is static and dynamic array ok make sense so so this is it I'm probly at anything I missed this phone so here this should have been
ok so so this is how you declare an array is here you see here they have taken the length and assign and memory erase when we look at memory erase so this is the condition in authority what its phases you can't change the size of memory array ok
so once you so there again you know there are different things ok we look that we look that static static array and dynamic arrays ok again that is a first we look that there are two types of variables right what is memory and storage OK where memory and storage ok show memory and storage rights
if you want to create array of type of memory so size cannot be changed ok for storage the size can be changed I didn't get you Shailendra 7 is going into f0 what is it me
we are not looking at samples in a we have included any samples yet ok so will come there just give me a second are you looking at this contract or are you into the next page you are looking into contract see ok so what is that what is that division
so this one you have 6 equal to 8 love ok sure your your allocating a size of 7 so you went memory of a new into 7 equal to your saying this I should be 7 ok
so he has 7 size your size is 7 that's right yeah ok ok ok this is not the value from ok so these are some of the practical stuff you can try out at home in at the end of this class still you have got one week
before next class so just try out the samples I have got a so this is how to then one more thing would like to mention here so when you write a contract right so it's a contract sample whatever contract you right so what happens is the default you write all functions ok so they'll be a function X whatever it is you're right the meaning in things so by default
whatever you're right before functions ok in typical in Java world diesel called class variables ok so suppose you declare a variable call you in 2 match something so this variable is called state variable ok and by default this goes to storage ok so this is a state this is called as state variable and by default this is of type storage
ok make sense your contract is the keyboard here in contacts the keyboard here just me know in case if it's not running and if you are trying to run something just hold on for a while will look at a simple program first to get started
question how do we know to use you in Torrent so for example if you are going to use salary ok salary there won't be any negative salary right so in that case it will be you IND or if you use employee ID there won't be any negative based on that you have to make a choice what use
ok so these are something and I just tried at your home like and how things are so the next one is Oriental literals and inline erase so what is the literal typically littoralis when you declare something you give them a value ok so if you enough assisting X equal to sum hello you say becomes a literal
so here there a little suppose if you see here they are stored you into 3 size is 3 and how do you pass array literal so this is a Syntax to it so some of you from non programming background types of literals are nothing but you know when you are saying most of the times you would get real time values but suppose if you want
assign a value value create a counter, new program so those are called and literals suppose a simple example would be we are going to write this contract for BMW ok so what you can say this string company equal to complete this becomes a string literal make sense so like waves for each and every variable you can
define literals ok so there soon as I hear make sense okay Sun next constance you can say constant also constants what happens constant one up if it is not changing then its called constant
ok so once you are from which programming background mainframes ok bye so the next one what youre going to look at this
ok mapping type ok so this is another Complex type mapping type ok so some of you from Java Sheesha background on Python cplusplus ok we have something called hashmap ok so for others from non programming background or first time into programming ok as the name suggests it's a map ok so what is the
Here they have something called key and value ok so this is so this is nothing but a map simple map ok so for example when you say one ok let's take employee ID ok one is an employee ID so sure let me give some real time examples key value ok let's say that ok drug Radiant
ok so tragedy drug value ok so for example druggie one it says Aspirin ok and drug ready to eat some Paracetamol something like that ok so this is typically in a java world this is called a hashmap
OK music ok so drug ready and here
what is also right ok so here for example you have this cooking Java world how it works is so you at the key and you have the value ok its called hashmap ok because this values will be has so that's why it's called hashmap so what happens there is a big difference between hashmap in Java or C plus plus which solid it okay suppose in Java world
ok in Java cplusplus or Python whatever it is if you want you can find out the size of the map OK so how much my map sizes ok you can find out like hashmap size if it is 10 then you can I trade the map accordingly ok but in solidity world there is no you cannot find out the size of the map ok so this is very important ok ok
this is not known OK so the problem you know since we don't know the size ok suppose if you want to find out the 10th element ok 10th element in the map it is not possible make sense you'll have to only way is you'll have
white rate and find out make sense ok so you will will see the definition and I'll give you some example so that you get an idea for others any questions
Raja reply from Shailendra but I want to know from others villas MC Sudhir Subhashree Rupesh Rakesh Mallika Farhan Anand all
good OK so the question from JSON why the size cannot be known for hashmap so that is that is the design ok so that so the solid it is being designed ok so that's why you don't know the size of it but it is a limitation that's right but we should explicitly increase the counter you should create a counter and Asin when we update the map we should have a counter and increment
okay make sense yeah length Ok why does required see you for example ok good question from home can't like you wanna why do we need to know the map says ok suppose you are creating a dashboard okay Dashboard of view right there is a webpage it it needs to display all the
drugs it has got ok so if you don't know the size you will not be able to pull those and show it in your dashboard do you need to know the size only then you can I trade get the details and shoot in your UI dashboard make sense so that's the reason why we need to know the size to I trade along with that ok
is it a generic based maths generic human like we can have different values right key values is that what you mean by templates in C plus plus yeah yes you can customise it
that's right Motia ok so bye Jason is like you know he is mentioned alternative to hashmap could it be Matrix services will know the size of the array yeah that's right we can have early inside array that is possible but a no in OLX
is it is not possible okay suppose if you have a array and with array you can have maximum you know you went or some kind of a structural arey that's all fine but if you want to go for a min Complex derivation then in that case it'll be VTU tds2 process there is an interface also movie TR
ok so this is a simple example of mapping ok so latest do the same thing also one example with the same drug example what you have done so I am creating a contract sample ok and Dumber
mapping ok my mapping States I am going to use you went ok and what I am going to use string ok so this is my mapping variable and letters call this one as drug details ok so here what I do if I have a simple function called
drug ok so inside this drug I need to add details ok so you see here I have a explicit counter ok so what I do here is so the key what is the key using this key
ok and what I am going to store in a let me pass this Valley ok so what we're going to do Assassin when we click on add drug
Sahir also will do a function get drug ok so what will passes will just passed the index of IT return
we should add a return keyword Returns
ok so this is a simple thing which I want to show you some mapping stuff ok yeah mappings ok so mappings let me show a real example so what I've done this have created a mapping so the mapping is between key and value so hear what I say is ki is some event number ok
under string it is a another value is going to be staying drug details is the variable name so what I do wish you'd drug ok so where going to add requirement to pass a drug name ok so ki what is the key key is nothing but the sum ki some integer value intvalue so that one I have nobody for this is zero ok so what we do if we compile it and every time
we store this into a map make sense so let's look at here we'll go to run OK so the first Epic compilation step ok once you compile you click on Run you can find out your contract name ok so what I do next is I click on create button ok now I can add the drug name so first drug name is aspirin
ok so what happens it got added to the next one does Paracetamol adrak ok know what I am trying to do it I am trying to retrieve the detail of the drug ok so I select zero ok so you click on this details you can find out the drug name is aspirin ok when I select one
PC Paracetamol ok did you get my pics
ok so these are based key value based ok so again I'll show ok so this is for clearing so get drug of index 0 so if you see here there is no way to find out how much my see what is the size of length of my hashmap or mapping
explicitly a maintaining a counter I'll have to that is all have to find out ok so I click on the details ok once I scroll down I see that it's that make sense okay so I need to know these things right so when I show it you'll make feel like a notice
some some light filter for you know Italy request practice by practice will get it OK it is a very simple language actually it has hardly you like enough for 6 variables and simple things if you know if the basics is right it should be pretty easy any questions from others Shri Sudhir Subhash Mallika
Rupesh Mohit Gayatri all good villas randomly calling some names ok so question from Sri Sri is so every file will have an address every contract will have an address ok so not be solved it so I be contacting 11 address Shailendra can we update value
yeah we can so we'll be running about code samples yeah that's right ok so you take this is an example ok so there are plenty of material and also use our material whatever we have given it in the class ok use this material try to create your own this coding details and try to explore more so that's the only way by practice only again to get it
exchange so next year I'm ok so I am typically Mano in any other language for that matter so instead of if we have some common thing ok let us take so let's take directions Here they are given action choices ok so for example if we write something like a GPS contract
so we need details like whether it is left right sorry north south east west right so instead of saying U and East equal to zero live instead of that we can say that in I'm directions ok and you can. Like oh what what it is like when it's when you can say north south east west ok so what will happen is buddy
Baldwin you refer when you refer this variables it. Save it. Sir ok make sense so this north by default 100 value of zero south ex 1 2 and 3 so this is our name works
ok so got it is about in I'm ok so try out these samples at your home whenever you are free father's nicer questions from Shailendra Mohit but others are we all good can I get get it
Yes or No if no I am happy to help let me know for and I don't see any questions from you today we good ok so next to struct okay probly what will do if we look at the struct and then will take a break ok so strict is another Complex type suppose you want to have a
lot of details ok a package of details ok so let's take a struct shipment OK when you want to track your shipment details what will happen you need to know your consignment number ok or tracking number there will be a tracking number ok and then the shipment perspective that'll be like
shipping detailed shipping some shipping description could be there ok and it could be there could be something like staying shipment address okay so likewise you you get a complex you create a complex type comprising of all these variables together and then, struck ok so typically in C plus plus uses
truck ok in where is in Java you what we do is write something like a class and use it ok so Now instead of struct ok so here you can use something construct in solidity world ok we can have mix and match Shailendra question is do we have a linked list here no Shailendra not that I know
its take a 5 minute break and then let's catch up
ok team I'm back sorry lot of questions
ok so so the next question is so what is the difference between struct and class in C sharp in C Scott there is a value type and reference type I don't know C Sharp Mohit what is super to Oriya trying to access what is the difference between struct and class in C classes lot of other property search
Marathi mentioned by Anand you can't in a return you can't do in the returns of structure and all right so class you can do all the stuff and you can have a inner class Social or not possible with struct Rupesh can explain structure again she win any variable stored in storage what is the reference point will that
the address variable will that be address variable for example when we create a struct for shipping details as part of the contract send it 2 blocks yes we what will happen is the reference point your question is write reference point will be address only ok that'll be a contract address using that address will be referring to that particular very so question from JSON hi Sunil can you
share the website for solid it to write the coach ok you want to remix win any variables don't say that reception
vanadium variables answer answer that question ok strukton contract ok contract and struct cannot be correlated meaning there is no comparison okay contract is like you create a smart contracts saying it's not like you can multiply in Java world or you can use class right sunglasses inheritance similarly you cannot
consider Contract contract but we cannot considered structures it is OK structures grouping some so once again I will go through struck struck if you want to group some of the variables okay instead of maintaining each variable separately if you want to group something to create a unified packages something then you go for a struct ok make sense
Rupesh Reddy get it ok fine so now we look at other variables what are global variables what what are reserve in a what all is available we'll take a look so these are some of the Global variables that is if you some
variables ok you look at a Navy look that gas limit ok let me show you difficulty and stuff like that if you go to etherscan.io and let's go to home I will kick this block ok so we look at the difficulty views find the gas used ok so block reward and details that ok this is this is nothing but your in a global
tables using your Global variables is what it is accessed ok so block timestamp where is it here it is this one and this one you see here we have this gas limit we have difficulties all those are global variables we can access so any questions
again these are other set of global variables so one I'll give you one simple we can look at one simple Global variable ok so we will use the same contract drug contract sample contract ok here what we are going to do if we have
nothing call constructor right in OOPS world there is something call constructor so it is nothing but the contract name and the function name of it is same it is called constructor ok so what I create here is I create something called address wanna ok and what I do here is owner equal to message not sent message lots and there is nothing but a global variable ok
ok so you should be returned ok so Shailendra what do you mean by can we override constructor
here there is no one like other language we don't have like in multiple constructors other language you can have in a one argument constructor to argument constructor it is in a just a single constructor ok and so what I am trying to do here is ok so there is I am I am trying to explain you like how this message not send that how we are using the Global variable
locate our PPT we have lot of things right message centre transaction origin lot of details from trying to show you one so now I go to run ok and what are you doing I do I create ok I am creating this contract note is here there is my account ok so I click on this dropdown I see that my account start with zero X what I do I click on to create
ok I know what you do a quick call this get owner address ok now I click on details I see it starts with 08 CA and stuff like that ok so what it is is when you submit when you create a contract ok at that time is constructor would be called OK when you create a contract when you get this create bundle this constructor would be called ok this contract could be created on this constructor
call so at that time it find out who's who has created this contract ok so that can be found from message not send and that's getting student questions case
ok others I got a no from Shailendra I hope others got it so once again I explain will be useful for you ok so there is a contract so we have created a contract what are you trying to say here is what is this Global variable I am trying to access a global variable here ok so what happens this function the contract name and function name if it is same it is called constructor ok so when I hit it
create button ok so what happen is this person this account right this account owner creates this contract ok and that time this also this function also be called ok so this account name write this name whatever you see here this comes as message dots and their ok so and what you are trying to do is your storing into a variable call owner and I am trying to find out what is the owner address
vixens Shailendra question is can be create a contract without having address when you mean this address no no so account if you remember we discussed about two things ok and the last less
donali old account and the contractor does Nokia CEO contact address should be always created by some external owned account so to answer your question Shailendra know these are some of the Global variables ok next 1 years and the mathematical functions like other programming languages
right so you have functions which you can take use of like you are some of the mathematical functions so I am not going to get Ok so these are other functions ok you can try out these functions ok so I'll give you one function to this is important function balance ok suppose you want to find out the balance of
ok the same program so you want to find out the balance of this owner ok you want to know the balance of it so what do you do is worth per PDF What we see address dot balance right so what we should do it return owner not balance
ok and install Aditi you can return multiple then it's not in any programming I can return only a single detail here you can return multiple detail Ok so I am returning both I am returning the owner and I am returning owner balance ok so if
freedom you create Ravi change the contact you'll have to deploy it again so I create again let me see if I compile a disorder company not a problem ok so now what are you doing it I can't get owner address account details so now you get to details so 0xc a there is nothing but the account detail and also you get the owners balance to balance you see here it is 99
pointer something ok so why you don't see a. Here is because by default the balance is returned in we get the lowest denomination ok like something either of returning $1 it is written 100 since it is raining in the lowest denomination got it so I guess you can try other functions in or transfer send other things you can try out any questions
please show me on so next next error handling functions ok so suppose
Nokia so I pass some value here ok I pass you went ok to hear what I say yes so this error handling functions is what is the function name assert ok so what he says assert
if is greater than 10 ok so now what I do again I have to create a Contract contract creation is done so now what I what I say so sad when it is greater than 10 you'll have to
Sana bypass to this is for clearing it ok to get owner address what happens it says some invalid opcode because it is feeling this is not what I am saying greater than 10 let me pass 11 ok so this succeeded do you see here the first on a road out let me try 10 is also have thrown another same thing this assert right
you can replace with what is it called document required ok so what you are saying is required is a greater than 10 again what I should do it again I should create a contract ok now I pass just 10 it is going to say ok then what I say I pass 11
successful okay make sense so why then you can ask me why can't we use a certain require a keeper sorry the documentation what they say is a certain require does the same thing okay there is no difference at all but if you know if your program in your programatically they wanted how to use suppose you are you having two functions ok this
function is called be ok just empty function ok so internally within functions you always use assert ok so what I will do as will use assert here there is no return or anything ok it's a test ok so between FIR
since you use assert ok and when called from externally outside when people call outside then use required so this is but both does the same thing it will work not at all problem ok make sense so that is the difference between assert and require make sense good
Rakesh so instead of showing an error can we display message so far that will have to go do something called events ok so will look at it now ok cool and for awhile Rakesh will see that so the idea is in a let me give a real example so that you'll understand
ok suppose this is a contract ok this contract what do you want to know this is what you are saying is you should pay me $10 ok if you pay $10 ok and here inside this you do some certain steps ok Android not reading the code I am writing a Syntax so if you pay $10 yes I would do certain steps ok
but if you don't pay anything me know if it is not $10 then I am not going to execute the steps ok for this type of conditions ok Shiv you something call require ok make sense so require is used got it so required what I say require amount has to be $10
greater than or equal to for example ok we can see either ok so this is what it is Vamsi Reddy waited ok so again you didn't get it a certain require ok you are looking at the different show
advise require you got it right what it is ok so as it is both are doing the same function ok so require you can directly substitute with acid it will work fine no not a problem at all OK so the general cleaners use assert within inside the functions ok inside contract if you want to check something then use assert ok but this this method is exposed out
ok for example let's do something like this ok so you have something like send funds method OK Here you use require inside here there is method like send funds you are going to send something to shipment ok
there is a shipment method here ok in the shipment method what they are saying is use assert ok shipment cost is $1 for example here you use assert not require so this is a General the way the coding standards this what they say use it make sense Vamsi did you get it
ok cool so Mohit so do we have public and private functions and contract yes ya Shailendra so shipment and send from both are and contraction lutheran contractor only so Jason so require is used in
public functions that's right direction yeah that's right word so whatever is exposed to world public so do it uses require and assert internally within the functions that's right Mohit yeah and for public functions we use require and private functions we use assert that right internal functions also we use assert yeah
Dennis is asking like in up there is no puzzle here what is that we are trying to solve so all these rates all these contract whatever you tried to do here finally what happens it becomes a transaction ok so I will show you something here when you create this contract ok now contract is universe created ok so this week
transaction if you click on the details you see this ok this you can see this this transaction mind and executed successfully ok this transaction mine so whatever you interact with blockchain so what hear what you have done as you have created a smart contract and deploying it in the evening ok so that becomes a transaction and that transaction goes to the miners minor things whether this is a right contract that was really at come from zones of person
did you spend in enough amount of gas so those all will be validated sold in the puzzle ok ok then the next one is another error handling and the next one is revert ok reward reward what happens is suppose your
meaning some be very careful suppose you look at here whenever you want to in or rollback all all the details suppose you have done something here ok you've done some changes here ok after some changes then it fails in the next assert UK these changes done is done ok but if you want to make sure that
if some changes are not there you want to revert back ok so if you do a reward what will happen is your entire transaction like a in a typical database world ok it'll be completely rolled back so that is what is called Steak night take care that your state is rolled back make sense about execution and revert state changes whatever you change or everything will be rolled back got it
these are very important actually suggestion there is a commit transaction also there is no such thing called commit transaction by default when you send a transaction it gets committed ok but suppose in your smart contract you find something and if you revert back still that transaction will be a while
transaction ok but it is like a phone no use transaction use Centre transaction it reverted back this like you again you have a proof that you initiated transaction that did not happen ok sweets record in blockchain under what condition do you use reward ok even we can use for payment related in a business standpoint for example
let's take this let me find a good example ok so suppose we find there is some mandatory parameter ok for example you'll have to pass the drug name ok drug order details drug date whatever it is OK suppose you miss the drug name
ok you cannot do anything with it in that case what you can do you can use over ok and equation guys
sugar question from Dennis so you must always have award function yeah what happens is if you don't have a revert ok so there is a chance that your state variable gets changed so you have some conditions Nokia return some details and after that you have an asset ok us at our checking some conditions what happened all those changes would take place in the contract ok but you want to be so sure
you know about it should not go through then you should use reward make sense when user revert even the gas will be returned ok but when you use acid or require whatever gas you spent is gone ok so we should take more care on when to use reward ok so these are ok then cya so now we are
when to look at this arithmetic and logical bitwise operators so I am I'll leave it for you it is basically you know addition subtraction solve those minnum Plus Plus all details you can try obtain a room ok so basic all operators are available in solid it you can use it jason's
so when you use revert the transaction that was mine done was part of the block megan's like a no use block right that's right it is go srmt transaction ok so these are operators ok so operators I'm leaving it to you ok you can try out and if else what all you can do inside control structure you have if else while like any other language
ok so by default how it will be initial eyes with by default in like any other language bullous Falls ok and Default value will be nice lies 20 any question guys on you know operators control structures so any
any tips you won't let me know if you had taken gotten a chance to take up there is a first intro class before even we start first chapter there was a prerequisite class JavaScript ok so if you had taken that it would have been easy in a first time programmers so not a problem if you
if time permits try to go through that owns so next input and output parameters so typically what happens when you write a function you take input ok over these are the arguments and when you return you know it is a return keyword when you want to return something is using a return keyword ok here here there is you can return multiple parameters and there is a
different way you could return also for example so what I am doing yes ok I am returning address send it right so here what
Dussehra turns instead I am using a return keyword here there is other way you could use Ok address my owner then you will it my balance ok you can set both of them here owner and you can say owner dot balance ok so what I am doing yes I am sitting what are the
and I am just removing this return statement hear what I do it's ok I can leave the way it is OK without return keyword what I am going to do is so this is going to be this is going to be
wait a minute in fact this is also not required if you declare there ok so this is a different synthetically how you can handle so here I mentioned The returns but it has to return so here I don't explicitly mention return statement
ok another way of handling it make sense in equation guys Vilas I didn't see any questions from you today are you good Villa Sudhir Mallika I didn't see any questions from you too hope you are good
ok fine so this about it so now let's want to the Clash ok see these are something for you to try out ok so after today's class you just open it all the samples right you can try ok
ok next next concept is function modifier OK I will tell you what this is this is one important so here instead of wasting time
so let me some create a new file is I am facing it so what happens is OK it is a simple contract ok and it has one constructor ok and it has one function call test function ok so normally what we do it return something right here have added one more
call to one Leona ok and what I've done here is have created modifier function so it is nothing but only wanted what I check here is if message right centre not equal to wanna throw ok so what it is means suppose you are having the ideas if you are having multiple functions ok and your contract is exposed to the outside world ok and then what you have to do is you'll have to restrict some functions
who can access what functions ok so let us look at 1 practical real time example let's click on this contract address
ok so I'm going to the contract source it see if they have something ok so they often do you see any modify example ok real time will see here only so see here I've create
this function ok so this thing call modify example ok Let's create it so this God created so nice and I have something called test ok test is the function name ok cycle context what is happening I get the return saying hello now see what I am trying to do is I am going to click on this drop down and I am selecting a different account ok so that is basically I am trying to
Axis from some other account I click on text OK what happens it is failing so here using this modifiers you can restrict what Funk you can access what functions ok so have a Contract contract by default we're all talking about public blockchain bright Sun public blockchain your contract is available anybody can view or contract correct but you can restrict your contract even though you see the functions you can restrict your contract
mentioning like this function has to be used by this person ok so you can modify it so that is what you have done here ok so here what was it is this only wanted should access this function where we have said so there is a test function we have mentioned this only owner so anybody other than owner it will feel make sense question from
Shailendra smart contract is visible to public also that's right it is available to public so that's why you see there is a bad contract ok so this is bat smart contract is available ok fine any question guys on phone
modifiers so basically it is restricting access like who can access what Shailendra so we can easily copy the code and modify as per your requirement and diploid that's right ok so next one is a function modified example this for you to try ok so the next one is a fallback function
ok so what happens if you're so sometime back when you look at 20:15 they have a concept call fallback function so that means this fall back function would be called once so every time your contract why'd you call something in your contract your call back function will be called where is this fall back function until unless be explicitly right there is a no for back function otherwise there will be a fallback
function if you want you can write ok so let me see I think I have an example
will use this only show latest use the same function whatever they were given
ok so this is contract test and we are having a simple function and we have something called payable you're married guys so I'm just looking too
ok so what we are going to do as we are going to create a simple function again I will create something called test
not waste time ok this is hardly take 5 minutes ok what I would do is let's not waste time on it so I'll show you what is fallback function ok so concepts leave what it is you have a contract sample okay sum Sum contract and what do you normally how will you can constructor look this is a York instructor looks right so you have fallback function how it looks is it will be empty
ok so this is your call back function ok so this is your fallback function so what will happen is moment when you call a function in related to payment something ok what will happen is after the end of it this fall back function would be in work ok but suppose you have another function
called get someone from outside world is trying to call this get function OK insaraf get there trying to call as GT get OK then what happens is what will happen is in the in your contract there is no function called get any in Caps get there is no caps get so what you happen is by default this will go to this fall back function OK what has happened is sometime back in the
air 2015 Holi 2016 ok so people used this call back function as a trap and they stole lot of funds ok so this was a bug in solidity ok so this fall by function what happened was they were always trying to call the function which was not present and here they returned some balance amount ok so they have return some balance to their own account ok so they did they did Sometimes this was a look and they tried
manipulated ok so this is callback function how to implement ok simply simple call you can show it I will show it in the next class ok let's not waste time are also eat after the break ok so let's not waste time on us any questions
location from Mohit so fallback function is a function without name and it would be invoked first after the function vacation and second is the function with that name is not found a function without the name the second one is right so call back function is a function without name that is right and it would be invoked or whenever there is a payment transfer
should be in work previously it was always getting in work ok so now they changed in such a way that when there is a payment related then it will be in work or ok or secondly if the name is not matching then also to be more OK I will show you the time when we take a break let me quickly know right couple of lines of code and I can show you that ok next 1 days
inheritance ok as we know that right solidity like any programming languages since this is object oriented concept this supports inheritance OK so how do we create inheritance suppose you have a contract sample ok you have something called contract test
ok so is sample ok a simple as that so this is keyword and you can write sample so this will in a create inheritance inheritance ok concept next one will try contract test to show latest rate
do this also ok so this in adding multiple contracts ok make sense guys fine so I am not getting into in a returns so those all are a totally different animal ok so if you are not good
oops concepts I need some beginning Nashe mention look at this tutorials or something or Ravi have beginners class like a prerequisite class try to go through that this is inheritance and then there is abstract contract ok so abstract contract is nothing but you know you can write so in the JAVA world or no cplusplus world so what is abstract contract is nothing but
you write a contract you define a function ok so in here only there is example ok so here what is there so here there is there is no implementation OK what they are saying is it just returns ok so there is a contract film and there is a method call at Orange ok so here what we are doing is the implementation has to be inside as simple as
what do you call suppose you have function at drug something like that ok and you can
why this implementation ok returns string so the implementation can be written outside ok so inside the other contacts udisa OOPS concept ok so Shailendra there is a question does it support has concept like to use object of has instance ok I don't think so
I have not seen that ok so the next one is like that is interface also ok let us find where is interface ok interfaces suppose you have you have an interface for several drug dealers
ok so they have you have interface interface pharma company ok and many of them are required to ok so many of them suppose there is a contract Cipla ok so there is a contract Ranbaxy ok I'll have to inherit this interface and then
write appropriate methods make sense yes no idea so others right so guess who are from non programming background how do you feel it and I know that dinner from programming guys they would be able to get it can I get a Quick yes or no I need some help some
that ok so I get a mixed review ok ok fine fine what are you dear
common destroyed take that in a prerequisite class ok so then you will be able to get it this one is inheritance and other construction this so the next one is even ok so will look at how evens works so till now if we are in a programming world you will be if you are in a JavaScript you always do console.log or printer so that is a we try to learn right so how does it work here
if you go solid it is awesome plus will take this contract sample ok function get ok so what I am going to do this event
detailed something like details ok so what we are doing yes I am just passing you went just say you went ok so here what are you what are you doing now sent in a Syntax face how to define this event event is the keyword ok and you can give any name and you can give whatever arguments would like to mention there so hear what I am giving his details ok and what I am going to give us
change.org disaster address sorry ok sorry message not send ok
trying to do is a life first let's simply execute and see like what happens OK it is compile let me clear this of go to run we heat on create button ok done so now going to hit get ok let's go to details when you go to details you find that there is a event that's been raised ok and you see that it is zero x
147 this water has reached this event ok so now I am saying I am selecting this one and I am creating clicking on get ok I click on details again and I see that so there is no the owner is different you see that 0xb 0 ok so why this is required why even this required is because OK when you in a blockchain world what you do is you send your
you continuously you know you send transactions you pay someone you get the details and see but after period of time if you are working in enterprise or somewhere when you say for example I work for supply chain industry ok soap in supply chain industry for us for vehicle manufacturing related stuff ok so I would have got products from different vendors I would have shipped back ok so all those details go in as a trance
ok for that particular transaction what what what has happened if I want to look at it ok so the easy way is to raise event if a raise event what happens is in the in the UAE world ok or if you want to look at like what happened to that transaction you can find out that so that is why you know there is this even make sense or while you write a simple contract and if you want to do
debugging step this is fine like how we do for console.log and stuff like that right so we can do the same here looks like my voice is breaking about others are you feeling the same
ok its fine ok fine can you check from your side ok so next to staples how to debug ok so Shailendra as how to debug I will
okay soil next will discuss about that so Mohit so these even sir send to Soi this even sir reached and its in blockchain OK it is there an the blockchain whoever wants to consume this events can go ahead and tell the what is the block number what is the event they can find it out make sense OK so the next to debug Bieber right before
looking will finish off and then I will show you how to debug I see and they will have to specify the contract ID or name as well they'll have to mention the contract address ok so what happens is when we create a contract OK your contract is in a your contract name you can create contract sample multiple times not a problem ok see here I am I let me create
contracts multiple times ok so this is a sample contract headed once again I created the same contract but you seen the address is different here it starts with xerox 924 it starts with A V OK so the contract address is what is important ok so that is the identifier of the contract make sense
ok so Anand is it ok now I have a check with others looks like their voice is made by my voice isnt breaking ok so question from Mohit so contract is a class and when you create it that's right it it creates a instance of a contract on the blockchain perfect that's right
ok so now we look at the remaining portions and then I will show you how to debug ok so otherwise lekin Aisa mention trade you can create a contract that a different ways like when you declare an array there is a way you could use new keyword similarly when you want to create contract you can using new keyword why they were brought and this concept is somewhat too much oops ok so people
Upar Rehne Java background will feel it easier ok they don't feel it nature totally different alien language ok so that's the reason you have it ok this new keyword so question from Dennis how do you publish the contract to network will see that you know in another 15 minutes will look and will log into the VM so at that time we will look at it ok so there is a question from Mohit
so constructor is only inbox once that's right it will be invoked only once Mohit like we would have a discussion session at the end right no more discussion session will have it at the next next class before that you can go through it ok so before start problem we can meet before like in 15-20 minutes and then we can look at it
I am completely fine to join early but in or not after the class 9 since I have a hard stop so but half an hour me know before if you want me to join for any questions I am in a completely ok ok so these are other means and also you can create libraries like how untypical Java world you create the Java any other language the commonly used functions you create libraries
and you deploy I tried so similarly you can do it in solidity to ok so in terms of normal time right so see the class in latest have between 8 and 11 only not a problem but in case if someone is very curious to know and understand more questions what will happen if you have like 10 questions
so it will take time so I am ok to come before sometime so if you want to hear if you have won a lot of questions in your mind to join before half an hour we can get it sorted out ok that's fine Anandi I can understand but in case if you want to get clarified more then I would suggest you to join before ok but otherwise it's completely fine
ok so so these are in a library is just shut out on your own ok so now I am going to show the debugging portion and then probly be here will take a break and look at the next module is not as easy as our you know our Java world or something like that ok so let's I am removing his contract ok
so what are you doing I created this smart contract review this is a drug contract ok and what I am going to do this I am going to add a drug name so first drug use Aspirin ok so I've added this truck I clicked on address so now if I want to debug this contract what I should do wish you see here so it got added ok so it got added details ok and
now I want to debug this one so what I will have to do is I'll have to click on this debug ok so this is like a low level debugging so what will happen is it has taken you to the devil all you have to do is next UK so so this is the next ok see I click on this next button ok it keeps going so there is nothing in here it is all added
suppose Let's create a failure scenario so require a greater than 10 for example ok and I am sending you NDA
so this is my so what I am going to do it I am going to create a contract done so now I will pass Aspirin and then I am going to pass one ok when I hit address what happens if failed write it failed somewhere it is not successful now I am going to debug ok so debug what happens it takes me here to this function OK then I click on next
ok so it it has taken you can see that what all values got populated when I hit next what happens okay it won't go from here so from there we can identify that this statement has a problem ok make sense so that is a will have to debug is more crude way actually so how do I set a debug point break. Ride
I think we can click on here ok do a left or not here so I think you can do a left click Shailendra so this is how will have to debug make sense and if you want to
top the debugging process click on the stop button ok so this will stop the deeper make sense it is not like the energy typical Java debugging will have to send a transaction it will fail and then you have to go back and debug so if you if its in Java other language what we can do is we can start and debugging process itself you can send the transaction and debugging mode but here it is other way around you send a Transaction ID fail if it fails then start debugging it okay make sense
ok guess so let's take a break ok so while coming back what will do is we will start our VMC ok whatever you install right so we'll start without BM and they look at some practical before we in this class today make sense
team are you able to hear me hello can I get a Quick yes or no ok fine ok fine ok so I didn't realise actually I was on mute no kids so guys let's all
explain testing sometime you there with me where you all
call to login ok so after logging in what I want you to try is open this terminal window ok click on it and type a less space I fun ltr and let me know like what you see here in the test RP
Harshal is it zero or is it having some values is it having value so what you'll have to do is click on this terminal after one she login to Terminal type in LS pe psiphon ltr find out what is there in the tester PC not shell is it showing 0
is there any other number again I repeat it so what you will have to do is click on this terminal window here you type in a less space siphon ltr and then press enter ok so there is some so anybody who has zero let me know otherwise not a problem
ok let me know if you have just 20
ok so there is some value right so that is what I want to know ok that's ok not a problem how about others
ok fine so everybody for Sandeep but still opening that's ok ok now I'll give up before it opens I will tell you like what we are going to look at in this class ok and so that you will have an idea before starting to work with practicals ok so it's a pretty simple one UK all steps are there
so till now what we have done is right we have work then browser solidity we open this remix ok and then type in some contracts and be compiled it ok that's all fine ok Real world if you locate Real world so it's not going to work that way but we are going to we should deployed in the real thing ok so now what we're going to do was we are going to use a simulator ok so this simulator
call testrpc ok so what does testrpc will you give us it will give you a set of public key ok and associated private key ok so what you are going to do the same thing what we didn't remix but remix is fine remix just to write a contract it's fine but you can't go beyond that ok so this tester PC simulator where it will act as a blockchain OK so this will act as a blockchain
Shudh for a blockchain so if you need to interact with blockchain you should have account address and value right by that basically should have a public key and private key so that also will be auto generated this simulator will auto generate and give you a set of public key and private key so with that we are going to work for now ok for even your project also will be wire tester PC OK so how to utilise the private blockchain I'll let you know but for now I understand where going to use test
ok so Roopesh Shetty be am confident ok Rupesh yeah but try to configure ok so when you would type in Sandeep if you type a less space I 1ltr you should I eat something call testrpc make sure that it is not zero ok so
how many questions on testrpc race so it is just a simulator so whatever you are going to if you look at Bitcoin or ethereum right so really there is a blockchain okay out there and you will have to deploy on it ok what this test API does for use how your private chain or public change works it is simulated for you so you keep sending the transaction it LOL work ok but you are not in a keep in mind that you are not directly interacting with the private change into
interner using a simulator that simulator is nothing but tester PC ok fine so all of you what I want you to do is now don't / / test RPC dot cell and press enter
all of you are done right so you can see a list of public and private keys so fine this is the first step ok so you should see is this private keys so these are associated public and private key so number 9 this is a public key and private key is here ok 8 this is a public key and super
ok done this is a first step so this is test RPC now what we are going to do is we will open another terminal so right click on this terminal and click on new terminal ok this will open another terminal ok have your dinner it now been here next command is type LS next
when does type c d space Explorer and presenter is it done you know if someone is facing difficulty just ping me in chat window otherwise I would not be knowing it ok so what we have done is open in another Explorer I'm in another window
F type then CD space Explorer and typed enter ok so now if you have completed this the next step is npm space start and presenter ok good so others who have NIC Mohit and all have gone to the next step that's fine
if I'm not the next step is Siri space Explorer and then npm space start OK what does npm do OK I will tell you that you try to insta 10 p.m.
space start until you npms nothing but node package manager ok so if you look at here we look that blockchain dot info ok never be loaded either scan data you're right so likewise if you want to look at your private this all public blocks right we got to know like what is the status of a public blocks but if you want to know the status of your private blog ok so for that we are
installing the stool ok so we went into Explorer and then started this so this is a open source tool ok now what I want you to do is ok till here is it all done anybody stuck these two steps ok both and fine now open your open your Google Chrome browser
OK Here type in localhost: 8000
are we good till here got welcome ya got welcome page ok fine so what we are trying to do is hear you click on blog 0 and you can find out like you know how whatever we are trying to find out from blocked blockchain dot info IT similar thing we have created ok
make sense ok now are we good tell here ok so now what I want you to do is open another tab ok so use remix remix solidity
there is no internet connection is that then ok where married for some reason
ok Jason you'll have to do this localhost: 8000 and presenter
it says when you do localhost colon 8000 seaside cannot be reached ok same thing with Jason also fine ok
when you clicked when you typed in npm space start and when you hit enter what is happening did it start a retail here so you should have gotten a message like this starting up http server serving upon 40000 did you get this message
yeah after npm start that's right Jason how about you you got this message got this message and still you are not yours I got the message ok so now you go here localhost 3010 works so anyone of you can Jason or Sandeep can you share your screen but Google Chrome issues there
let me let me find out can you in any wallet really know who wants to share screen Sandeep Jason Jason anybody Sandeep a good ok Jason ok I'll go with Jason Jason I made you presenter can you share your screen
no no no you I hope you are trying it from VM write inside view correct you open your Chrome
how you are not even able to open your Chrome ok you got it ok yes coming I'm right yeah ok fine here thank you about you want to share your screen or is it working
ok Sandeep Sandeep do you want to share your screen
Sandeep do you want to share your screen OK go ahead
Sandeep you are able to see right it's working right hello
yeah I can hear your able to see I have to see what now if you see my screen I am getting this message allow access to GH and refresh the page for some reason write I am not able to see your machine heavy saree yes you send me that
ok yeah yeah that's ok you are able to get till here right that is what is 1 what happened is localhost 8000 without has you type what I what is happening now can you go to command prompt can you show me like weather weather testrpc Ja
this is going to the second one you have to start this is not close it start this tester PC another window this is already start right right
organising that set npm start this can you start it Sandeep What needs to be done to start it know the first one good dot / tester pc.com close that but I did not got
dot / testrpc dot shell interview go to the browser ok
should you click ok ok so you shouldn't stop at ok so basically what what happens is this page is interacting with your tester pc so that shouldn't get stopped ok thank you thank you
ok so now what are what we are going to see is so we're all here right now let's open remix solidity for some reason I am not able to open it so others are you getting internet connection error unable to open it
you are able to open it right ok fine I can guide you not a problem so what are you doing I would take someone's machine as remote ok so it'll be better I could do you know since I don't want to get into internet conversation in internet fixing now ok anyways so Shailendra OK I will text
kendras machine ya sin and can you share your screen
hello Shailendra can you share your screen hello hello can you share your screen yes I've done ok ok I know its ok now guys all of you right so what you will have to do next just can you go to remix solidity ok so now
can I go to compile not a problem go to go to run ok so here can you click on create have already created so what we are trying to do the right now guys normally what we do we do I click on create so that is what we do right now instead of that
ok I can you fly into Shailendra can you close both of it there are two contracts been created can you no no not that one sorry close this valid contract here right next to it yeah no no no no so you see balance right below that user create ok so below that you see balance 0x 69277 memory below that just right
right below that yeah there is a into mark on right to your extreme right ya close that and close once again ok so what happened this guys what happens is by default when we create a contract so everything works in solidity browser ok so now we are going to do with when you deploy contract just imagine that it is going to hit the blockchain ok
for that in the dropdown box all of you right I listen carefully in the dropdown box you see something called JavaScript VM ok can you click on that ok click on select web3 provider click on it ok Yukon ok again ok click on Ok again ok so now all of
it will have to what you'll have to do it in your address bar ok at the end of it you can see a small batch like symbol with into in the address bar ok yeah so the one here click on load unsafe scripts ok do I reload
Swadeshi following OK it is compiling ok
now click on Run ok now select from the dropdown select go to dropdown select V3 provider ok ok click on ok you can Ok ok now click on create
create button ok so now can you go to the sun it can you meet your looks like there is some noise not Sandeep Shailendra can you mute so now what you'll have to do is ok so now what we have done as we have
created a contract normally in the UAE we created contract ok same thing same thing we did hear but only thing is we chose the third option ok we chose the 33 provider ok now Shailendra can you go to show the terminal window go to the terminal window click on it once again you click on it that should be another window yeah you see here
you get lucky get balance is get blocker what happened is you created a transaction ok so let's once again you know what you do is click on any can you minimise this other window this npm start Window can you minimise it so now you click on the create button again
you can create again ok once after creating can you go to the terminal window game ok it should be kind of very fast can you click on create and do all type real quick okay so you you cannot hear that get transaction receive get blocked number and stuff like that ok what happened here is ok you have sent
transaction to the blockchain environment in this case our simulator ok so we have send a transaction to testrpc now go to the browser now go to ethereum block Explorer click on no no no no there is the first step right click on the first step first tab
yeah click on that ok now you refresh it now you can see there are multiple blocks what has happened is ok we have sent a transaction ok that is why we have clicked on create button so that is nothing but a transaction so that transaction was formed as a block and it got mind ok all those things have happened behind the scenes ok now you can open on the Explorer the block you can
select some block and see like in or whatever what we have done ok guys so others were you all able to follow ok fine so this is what is happening ok so Dennis was
in sometime back like you know how do we connect to the blockchain how do we deploy to the blockchain so right now what we have done as we have selected testrpc and then we are deploying our contract ok so it goes there get deployed and transaction happens okay so similarly you can connect to your public chain you can connect to the private chain it is all possible ok there are different ways you can do it 1 days from you are you can do it when the remix browser whatever we have done right using that we can do it there are other frameworks
like I'm truffle there are other frameworks OK I will be teaching you one Framework ok to using that also you can deploy to the real network make sense so question from Mohit like in the blocks transaction is there a way for us to see what contract got executed know those details won't be there but below if you look at it you can
I don't like what was the transaction about can you scroll down Shailendra so who has initiated this transaction those details you can see you can see here so this transaction this 089 right so this person has initiated transaction so that's why you say from OK so how much amount of gaseous spend so all those details you can see
ok so Sandeep looks like you know Sandeep has got an error unable to not possible to connect the with three broad make sure the provider only thing what you will have to notice guys is ok see in your address bar let me show my screen
give me a minute let me show share my screen ok Sandeep what you have to do is ok so in the address bar right at the end of address bar so this is address bar so and end of it next to this favorites I can you can see a bad with
in fact it's there in the hour PDF also if you follow here not hear you look at here so there is
mark ok so just click on this click on load unsafe scripts then you should be able to connect it ok Sandeep can you give it a try so guys so we are you now we are left with like another 5 minutes so anybody having tiffin
it let me know so what is we are neither vs the smallest denomination ok so like how I don't know if you are the last class so if it is $100 so you even if it is a $1 in 100 cents constitut $1 105 2nd Street 1 Rupee correct so similarly so many ways constitut Anita so how many ways can shoot Anitha this one followed by 18 zeros ok so that much of we
constitutes one either so Shailendra have installed mattum metamask so metamask will see next class we don't have time till there so till what we have explored ride till that you go through the next class we look at metamask
ok not a prob yeah so how to do a transaction ok so I will give some tips ok so for some reason its not working in my machine ok so bye don't want to troubleshoot now see if you click on this this is a transaction ok so I've got this one right I click click click on create so this becomes a contract or latest take this example I go to compile
go to run ok you notice carefully here when I click on a create this becomes a transaction ok so if I want to add a drug name se ABC someone ok when I added this becomes a what is it it should be later than ok so I added so this becomes a transaction ok you transact to sample business vending see all these are transactions
ok so there is a question from JSON how did you get the Wii information ok we information so if you go to inside a transaction ok you see here as value is Zero B ok same thing you can use your block Explorer and find out how many ways it was so for example
dear click on this OK then from here you can find out ok here there is no way but if you look at the 2nd Block right so there is only one block I mean on my machine has some internet issues so if you click on the sets blocks 2nd Block 3rd block you can find out the information
is that ok any question base
hello guys any questions
200 Jason 600 in the minor field ok that's ok not a problem just ok right now right it is a test environment and everything is set to zero so that's why I maybe you are saying it is not a problem thank you always fine not a problem so we'll all meet let me know ways if you are coming up in early so we can meet up and discuss on the questions
