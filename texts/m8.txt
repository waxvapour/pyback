Egmore news Sudhir I think it's only you only let me know if you have any questions
Yeshu Divya yesterday private
and on top of ethereum is it also called a permission blockchain no it is not called it is so private why it is not a surprise so how different is it from the public I sure that are coming out is it the same I'm in they do the same thing what we did yesterday no they what they do is see we tried to connect to
CID call Don number 1 2 3 so when you look at Isha Chawla participating in the public Chainsaw public chain is number one ok network does network ID number one so all of them are trying to release a coin on top of the public stitching ok I suppose we created this price changes to the right one network ID 123
world doesn't know that we have such a network ID suppose you want to create a coin between your organisation ok like one is like IBM coin ok and also you create a Microsoft coin that can create that but it is only known to your company ok chain 123 that we created suppose if I want to cry
this for my organisation can I create a complain for my organisation on 1 to 3 August has to be on change one itself no no you can choose any other number which is not used by the public she ok ok so then the so so much questions that are happening they work on chair I do want itself because it's on ethereum blockchain
that's right ok if its there working on it Aryan blockchain do they have my nerves for their own project or they use the same itarium - 33 - ok ok 35 if I if I have a use case that light makeup public use case and I want to create a chain on top of stadium
and I don't need to have minor specifically for that right so I know ok so it will mean if going supply chain for my company and I wanted to have certain suppliers that my company and few other participants joining game then I can't use chain one right because then Delhi Public - I don't I wanted to be only limited to my companies
participants in that case you should go for a complete private check which we did yesterday this one one last question is in terms of private chain in with the advent of immutable data bases that exist today when I don't know it was hard for me to comprehend the you
the use of miners in a private location because already tested parties are there then why do you need Mining in private blockchain so for ethereum bitsler ethereum is built like that ok so they are not built in a day build that you know if a transaction has to successfully go through money has to happen ok ok but in a private chain so that is the rule or that is a protocol which is there
no way you could bypass this mining process hole mining process because you know that you have a trusted parties but is ok so you will have to change that in the code underline IBM code and then rebuild and you can use it in that case I won't need - no so then what was the consensus mechanism that it is different and proof of work that there won't be any consensus whatever transaction you send it will go
automatically ok so that is one way but again there is a problem that right so there is no consensus what so if you look at JP Morgan OK what they've taken the site area code right so they've taken this ATM code therefore that ok from get up there modified in such a way that they have introduced to consensus algorithm is called
another 1 minutes not top of my head but they have introduced to algorithms okay consensus algorithm slapped and another one which really be very insta instantaneous ok Asus there is no mining but the consensus should take place so they have talked to the code and they were written it in such a way make sense so you can also do it suppose if you want to
build pbf TS and algorithm ok and you don't want proof of work and you don't want money you are allowed to do since it open source you can take it and modify the coat according ok symptoms of private blockchain based on whatever is available in the public domain which do you consider is the most interesting so that I can take a look your asking about the platforms
who to use Kese Kese use case the interesting ones are surprising ok because if you look at the supply chain recently metals scene articles like ok 11 is WalMart right Walmart what they've done as they wanted to track the goods from where it is coming there that it comes from China
what is it coming is it a legit product ok who is signing this so they wanted track this right so if theyre going for a public saying ok so they are bringing in all the users into public chain which is which they don't trust ok so already already their business is running fine not a problem only want to make sure that the product is legit that it brings
value tell me thats value to supply chain is a very good use case UK another use cases remittance when we unite the first charging second class we have seen in the remittance world that is you transfer some points from US to India you are paying a significant amount of fees and there is a delay right even though we don't find a daily use services like xoom money transfer it fast
still the real time settlement is taking long time that is reconcillation ok so all these you know all these using platform like Drupal can be against private seen it makes it faster even your dollar or Euro transfers ok so that there is another example thanks thank you
Kaisa discussion with Sudhir so anybody else let me know I can Unmute him 810 I am open to questions let me know
what I can say go ahead. Yeah one thing is if I am starting a blockchain what am I doing if I have to explicitly start a minor
what am I doing is what my question is one thing second question is what so I got the aspect that in the core is written in go language even is also button in go language and helium is exposing JavaScript API kind of Switzerland sickly giving me a JavaScript adaptor on real I can
cute the various JavaScript onchange and now that read on yes and but when you say that you are actually using the web three JS so that is basically that I am going to be connecting to the blockchain courses on some particular port and then I would be stay interacting with the AVM of the road right
my my question is like this so does it seem so if I am how would I would I connect to a particular node I would I connect to a blockchain and if I would connect to 16 let's have a third client right so would you the question that I have it and then I can take it for a first question is what I am I doing like another word for station right so I am connected what is the difference between what is the difference between
starting to get client with the genuineness of first day first we initialise the get with the Genesis block I got that part with my blockchain my created one block in the blockchain with Genesis the second time I started the road now if it is and then I have to exactly explicitly start a minor so what is the what is the point of starting the node if I have to explicitly start the mind OK so the idea is right
you said you start a blockchain OK so why you want to start a blockchain first of all this it's because that you want to create something Private you don't want to participate in a public blockchain ok so prob public blockchain if you want to participate you'll have to download all the notes on all the blocks and this is for your company's requirement or your organisation requirement you want to set up something Private so that is why your setting up ok with different and what is this
just block it is the first block some that should be some where you go to start so that being my question is my understanding of blockchain was an immutable and mutable database can come into that and I am just coming to that ok so this is where the Genesis block and why we started my name is because so what should happen is when you make a transaction whether it be private chain whether it be
publishing OK when you make a transaction to the blockchain ok so that has to be validated by someone in your network so that entity is called minor and someone in avfc in that these transactions in a just 2 not 10 transactions are not just get validated and added to the thing in the eatery in world is transactions is validated and after validation this is all consolidated into a block and then stored as a
not my arm in blockchain ok after Genesis block ok so Genesis being the first block ok so now this gets stored block block by block acerbic little here yes but I think my my question is coming into is the point that what would you call the process that we are running inside which we are kicking of a minor is what my question is
specifically so Ok why we started mining you know why my name in what is the question and it is clear and why we are doing the mining because we have to Reconcile the transactions we have to validate the transactions and all that but even before we go to the mining we start the GF GF client of course I mean it again ko that is written in go language query I'm cool that is not a
line that is not connect send this is a full load with minor capability is inside it correct correct so what made you don't say that I can I think today you going to show us how to speed up multiple multiple nodes within the same machine but that this is nothing but spinning up full node get with the Minar inside right so I
or so and it is it is possible for me to kick that on without wearing the mining correct yes now when I click that on what is that crosses going to do with it seems to me is that any block that would be processed by any minor on the distributed network exactly be communicated to this node which would not be a minor
we just get chicken cool and this would just get just this will just maintain the blockchain is that where exactly switch basically just like we run a database process that has a back and files in database files this is also backend process that has database files behind it which is even this is using level DB or anything I'm using a different kind of DB level TV everybody is Losing level DB
what college level DBS for state in a meeting in this date so isn't blocks maintained inside the level TV know it is my intern oxide their binary is the permanent storage of that then that is there inside there is 4 dimension read data directory data clear that is where all your blog should go
interesting really cannot perform a query on the blocks or anything like that whatever this process is a part of blockchain and full stop you cannot go back and forth between the blockchain you can find out like what transactions happened you can look at that in so that's why we are looking in a when we look at it risk and daughter you so what we do was suppose if you want to know about this block
we can carry some basic details like what all transaction has happened between who and whom ok all his actions what is the balance we can look but if you want to build on further ok in the enterprise scenario this information may not be sufficient locate the balance and other details you might need some other information which would like to exposed to the outside world then events comes into picture be discussed about even tried
I'm not going to the event my point is that this etherscan.io why this site let me know if this much is this must be running of full blown ethanol ethereum node behind the scenes and then whenever whenever a block gets published they are at this particular moment can they go back can they go inside the data directory in can they actually go to individual blocks are they going to individual blocks is it like only the top block in the cannot go back
no no no they are going to the individual block so they can go in between previous right arm so and they are some JavaScript API which you can using which you can go in between back and forth exactly who is this I mean is this efficient to our screen not to store block inside database but to store on straight away on the file is trying to understand
advantage what UK tourist it is all hashed writing all these blocks are in a hashed linked together and each of them like you cannot change the in entity summary will have to store it so whether it be database or whether it be flat files somewhere that should be ideal either should be a link and you know any tampering supposed there is some this is blocked one and this is blocked too and follow
I block 3 ok so someone tries to edit block to the entire thing is going to change so the chain data folder actually contains the whole blockchain m.al DB files The Other light the level DB files of growing state yes exactly and ok and where would be the exact files showing the actual blocks of the blockchain get the dimension in Chennai
yeah same data but is there any specific file all these level DB files are showing the actual blockchain I think should be level DP only ldb or Blk today will execute yesterday what we did this we just generated the graph when we make some transaction will find out how outlet store and my next question
project so my next question was that I understand that but I am connecting to a database I am actually specifying and host and port and username password right and that's why I connect to a particular so let's have a database cluster I still have a master node to which I connect and then that masternode tries to INR applicate the database to do something like that and this particular scenario what is it
distributed kind of Vs WI yes so when I use the Deep web three JS client would I be actually connecting to a node or would I be just connecting to a blockchain and if I would be connecting to a black blockchain how would I how that is working right behind the scenes is that it does my client also kind of becomes a node in the network and it is only
push base model how can I actually so very first time I spin up I get all the blockchain data and then anything happens on the blockchain I get informed as well how does how does that going to work if I just want to let safe I just want to connect to blockchain and use the ww3 JS client and then just get the top note right so would I be connecting to a specific node I would I be connecting to actual blockchain to you
actually connecting to actual lunch I suppose you are running a node ok so use this you know you have two machines ok let's say that one is in California and you have fun in Washington DC this is where you are not 1 runs if you have full load and we have a block
same here everything is here ok so what happens if you when you want to know the state of blocked or if you want to read a blog I am so you are great let's see my client is in my clients in Delhi and these are the two nodes that maintaining the blockchain and doing the mining in you're not doing everything please of full blow full blockchain notes now my client is in Delhi right now my client using Web API JS node API would ever to try to connect
loaded connect to DC or disconnect California or would it how is that not going to work is Nokia CEO Delhi gay rights over the idea is ok as it is blockchain he can also run up full know ok you can also wonderful note and download all the blockchain and query from the blockchain itself I know no need to go to California noda Washington DC not ok so no one is stopping this Dileep
send to query California Washington DC but suppose your daily client is just a mobile client is just using his mobile phone and he is not worried about where he is going from ok and all he needs to. Does anyone of the notes using some port number says post this is in port number 8545 this is 8001
metamask whatever we have seen ride so what is happening with public blockchain as many of the wallet companies also what they do is so the blockchain itself in a the they maintain supposed latest Ek metamask Keemat Amazon has all it's blockchain running OK then make sure that no its up to speed they have a specific mechanism that whatever you fit right it does it is tamper proof and they have their own algorithms
option in Adobe of port number so what this Delhi mobile can do if they can switch from this using this matter was Euclid so basically the all the nodes are full blown a blockchain notes and I delete speaking this should be in sync with the blockchain so you think that you connect two node one or not to doesn't matter if you want a lightweight communication but if you want the full blown communication
you got a BF full node itself and then operate your clients against US full blown node is exact exact opposite has can we might be doing is the might have the onset of full blown nodes and they might be talking to those full blown notes to gather the information and handover the web on the web interface that's right yeah yes thanks thank you so much thank you sweet is more of p2p sinking kind
I think like but it's just more more more push based the transaction is post on to all to the nodes whenever cannot process the block then it got cast 3rd block on to the whole network is left is right then comes the question does every node knows about the next node so other nodes vs windows so no one knows that there is another network that another node has joined in that is not to you
do you something called gossip protocol so now what happens if we all connect to saying that should be some common network idsa be connected to same network ID call 123 so based on this protocol is called as gossip protocol so what they do is initially they start some gossip messages and find out like who is my next to peer closest closest pair and then they close
and so now I'm sorry I am one more question I have is when I am running my private blockchain and if everyone have so there are tons of nodes right now running in ITI winning and processing ATM Block Jayanagar why does nodes are not picking my so when I spend up when we spin off the node yesterday with GF using GF why that know why some
the note 8 by that no didn't talk to some other node and say you know what I found your PF balance in your case I saw the fear that I want to check that ok so I haven't seen one in the public world but you know somewhere someone has maybe it is our way only in our class only we tried 123 right so somebody might find the network and sir
but thank you much thanks so I think next got some questions from Shailendra how to check the balance for a particular account ok so balance for a particular account is address dot Bala
so that is why you check it if you look at in the solid ITI level ok suppose you have an address variable you have this your address okay send if you want to know the balance address owner so when you die in a when you find out on a date balance is I'll give you a balance go to Shailendra
and what is passphrase passphrase passphrase is nothing but if you look at our what we do is for passphrase when you create account ok I should you two directories one was data directory and other one was a keystore directory if you could remember so inside ki Store
directorate me have Oliver accounts it whatever accounts be created it was all here Account Number 12 whatever it is ok and What happens we know that for a fact that it area more Bitcoin works in public private key concept right so if you create it will all re always generate a pair of keys if suppose if 08123 ok this is a public key private key could b0x 456 ok to generate sub
using this passphrase so when it gets stored in your machine OK it is not the actual private key it is the encrypted version of private private key which is stored in your folder make sense so but when I am trying to create a new account it is asking for password that's what so when you are creating a new account it knows that this is your public key and
which is in which is going to get generated ok and it also knows the private key private key using passphrase it encryption stores year make sense how will how I will pass from where I will get it let me on YouTube so we can discuss
please others right so let's spend some 10 minutes and questions I stay there was a break right so let me know if you are having any questions just keep it ready we'll discuss Jago it I am running the private today and try to create a new account
enter passphrase I understood the private key from where I will get this private key you can you create a new account right yes so new about your I am on my prompt and I want to create account new create a new account so you are defining the passphrase
personal dot new account that time but what is the best OS it is asking you for you know you are defining the passphrase you are telling what the password has to be here that's what you are you ask to enter passphrase right so your defining it like it is something like you enter a new password for your account and enter enter password for your account or enter again okay class q
it'll be into steps did you get it question for someone to steal my Bitcoins they need passphrase as well as private key
actually Bitcoin world in at the store it assess the eatery in world in theory I'm world store encrypting at encryption store but what they do enough the general recommendation is even though it is encrypted ok people can bring ok with multiple combinations so what day is suggest you to do is ok does one level of encryption but you know please make sure that
you encrypt again is what in other recommendations yes ya going so I'm losing it confuses on it so so they can the brute force attack and then figure out my private key how would they kiss my past face
once I have encrypted my private key using the passphrase this is a normal normally write your passphrase your password for something people could do this work ok wait but that would be good for that would be proof of Race is normally right people tend to give the some other user account password maybe you could have given in some web
write that password so people might ride to use that ok so it's better that even though you store A pass phrase used passphrase again you can double encrypted ok see you trying to say that by default by default ssh Keygen generate private key and public key combination can always encrypted so while doing this is kitchen it always forms for
passphrase another time you can provide your passport and it becomes A1 level encrypted now you can put another level of encryption by actually encrypting the actual file with some encryption command of your own is that I am saying yes ok so now somebody first have to do for 1 developed decryption manually and then SSS I'm in some the prompt would especially come for password so in case of Bitcoin
go straight away using private key and public key they were not using they were not using the this passphrase right now I have one more question so I understand like I have use ssh and while doing the sources you generate a private key and public key right now how is this is this the same private key public key and private key but it is not there
when public key private key is generated there are many algorithms ok so whatever is used in Bitcoin is an elliptical standard standard
I can read ecsd base private key and public key in online by searching something and not format would not exactly match to the format that they have to do some kind of processing on top of that no no no they are nothing but the private key and public key of that exactly
wallets because they can have 100 keypad company public key private key combinations does friend and all the transactions that you would say against that Wall it is basically what you're saying and its like public yes so easy so if I just go online and say ecsd generate me a private key and I use that as can I can I get the money somehow from the network of ethereum and get transferred to any CSD private key is what
yeah I think I haven't tried that but in ethereum world ok you can create your own accounts as you mention drive you can create your public private key using this easy and you can specify like what is the account number you need ok ok but I have not tried that problem I will take a look and let you know next class but it is possible to mention like what account number I need that is basically the
public private key thank you thank you for this any questions passphrase is stored in the keys used your folder no no no pass phrase is not stored in a key or store food so what is give me a minute
ok so
you are entering Sunil you can trying to encrypt using which secret text enter secret key for encryption 0123 ok encrypt ok so I get some number here right so this is not stored in think it is a combination OK it is like a combination of this you get the latest now try to decrypt it
and decrypt password encrypted password is 10123 encrypted this is the encrypted text
OK Google secret key 0123 ok so if you look at here right now so what happened is have given my name ok and we are encrypting it so this is nothing nothing but your passphrase I have given my passphrase like 0123 encrypted it so I get a completely string called in our sample number so I can use the same jumble number using the same passphrase whatever I will give
I can decrypt it you can see that Sunil is back here ok so same thing like you know your password is whatever a password is your entering so that includes that and stores that as a file without this password suppose if I give 2012 ok it won't give the it'll be invalid OK it is not storing it anywhere make sense
ok fine you are right now with you so question another question from so what is logic Lake salt I don't know what is what do you mean by that others having any questions shall be good and start Shailendra can you explain a bit like what do you mean by this salt
about ICU salt encryption but it is not working on the system know it should work or probly if you have forgotten your pass
it's not going to work or can you share your machine that way I can take a look ok this all of you in a try to reboot your machine virtualbox will continue from where we left yesterday
jagvinder Shailendra New York and screening
what does balance we should put double quotes ok the account number right so can you give double quotes but no no you are saying if not blocked number that gets just say
yeah it is coming now but when I am create account new account number
I'm not asking you to enter a new password
I'll ask you to enter again EDM iron now you can you click create a new password ok ok ok all I got
ok so I fixed my VM maybe freedom it so all of you right so yesterday what we did as we started the virtual machine and then started with mine
are we all there are we all good till there can I take someone's Machine it's hardly I am going to walk you through some commands
then we are going to ok so can you share your terminal window Mohit
I'm not once again ok ok fine so now so all of you I hope you are still here ok
can you type in minor dot stop minor dot stop and open the prices and close the braces and all of you right by this time you would be you could have been wondering like you know I started the minor it's all fine ok but there is I haven't sent any transaction what is that it is getting mind OK
so u c successfully filled in U block and you get a reward and stuff like that right you it keeps on it it is getting mind OK Here In the history of world what is happening is even though there is no transactions ok and empty block would be created and if someone Minds that empty block they get a reward make sense
ok are we getting it so Sudhir and others like we have phone karne Rakesh fukin were you able to fix your machine the DNS issue Subhashree Anand ok ok fine
empty block but there is no transaction that's right now what we will see if we look at some of the commands type 8.8.8 counts enter ok so now I know these are the accounts we have created now let us look at the first
balance ok so if not get SBI and yeah and in double quotes you can say that your copy paste it entered and you can find the balance why the balance is like 3.2 + 21 mistakes it's a very big number remember whenever your balance
is displayed all what would happen what would typically have finished it will display in the unit of we eat the smallest unit is we write like the how are $1 and Hunter 100cm likewise in either world aquarium old is called be ok one followed by eating there so that's why you see a real big number and you can use mix and match of commands also can you type is not get balance
ok so you can can you remove all those that start with just open places open places so eat.in Raat accounts can you type any threat accounts yeah and open a square braces 0 closet and ok so likewise also you can
you can do a mix and match basically is always like how are you want to know once you could study this libraries like what all commands can be used be good to go then type admin.ac.in double tap so these are admin related commands ok so if you want to add a new beer someone
you know some suppose I have a machine and you want to we both want to interact OK then we can use admin.py at Pier command the first one but we are not going to do right now and can you type admin.in Odin for inter
so here if you see so there is a lot of information which is coming up ok and if someone wants to connect your node OK so the important thing like how in typical when in the networking world what we eat in the what we do is typically we give our IP address to someone and ask them to ping to make sure that connection exist right so similarly you have something called in on here ok you look at the first two parameter in OD and OS it is having
big number and followed by this 303033 ok so using this only we will try to connect what do you want spend time on connecting and also want to show you like you know what are these and then now type admin.in type mining dot sorry top Tech mining dot dot
the typo meaning double tap can you trust double tap nothing yourself ok minor that ok so there is ok can you open admin.py time is there
Nokia forget mining dot status there is a way you could find out whether your mining any doubt status minor daughter start stop now or ok
got it daughter not get my name is not mine sorry 3rd - enter without a doubt enter ok at returns false meaning that there is no mining money is not happening right now shall we do a minor that start and then do it
when you can find out that it is true message ok so now we can do a minor dot stop so I'll just take a pass I will show you one simple transaction how it works ok let me before that guys
having any questions let me know so I got a question from have two accounts how to mine for other one ok so if you are good to hear what I'm going to do is so all of you can type ok let me quickly take my eyes are we can do it here only ok so now
is the mining stopped right Mohit yes ok now can you type latest try to find out the balance of the second account can you type is not get balance if not account of 1 and enter ok so there is zero balance
MS if you don't have an account ok try to create personal dot new account can you create one and show Mohit like me know others if you haven't created one this is the way you should create personal dot new account enter and enter some perspiration you would be able to create an account ok
looks like fine now let's do it wrote accounts presenter if we have 3 accounts right so second account bhi
when we look that the balance there was nothing in there right now I am trying will try to transfer something can you do it not send or if not double type fast can you type a double tap ok so we'll do a send transaction ok I type send transaction ok open braces
do from from no no that should be from so from whom you are transferring from colon if not account of zero in this position of accounts
f0, to iterate accounts of one ok and come value ok one followed by 18 zeros Y1 for updating 06 nothing but we are trying to send one either close the braces
Ente Tinku wait a minute so probably think the double quotes matters happily unmarried
ok let's do one thing can you give me access a real quick you have that I have for keyboard might not work
I want you to do is ok right after this dress is right add angular places are not angular I'm in curly braces yeah it is JSON object and I don't have to use
going in with curly braces before 13% if I have to unlock the wallet so this is because the account is locked so there is a way that you can unlock your account also
ok I think it is so try personal dot unlock account ok and in braces you can mention like it route accounts of zero ok so what we try to do here is at home
ok good I got unlock now let's send a transaction ok so now so let's hold on for a while is very all able to follow let me know if you have any questions okay and also I'm going to send you these couple of commands can you copy and send to me Mohit
no I need the other one also he tried send transactions ok and send to everybody so this is the first command is to unlock your account OK so the next command is to send a transaction
so can I get a Quick is yes or no once you execute this I will take and A pass can you just complete and let me know ok so Jason then how about others Anand
Subhash Vilas I have a question Sunil I just give me a minute like ok so I take it as a question I am so as of now this is I got the point that the mining is going on and whenever
my name is going on a block what gets United and it'll be located to the first account it kind of thing or specific Ocean is so is it already working like a blockchain cryptocurrency by design I don't want it to walk like a to currency I don't want it to locate and mine and give coins I just wanted to to pay me the blockchain of the
after transaction rate of some sort of transaction so this was a question has to be before we started the class discussion in mind so I understand like so enterprise scenario for any matter that you know why why should I go with the cryptocurrency why mine ok so you don't want to get into that ok so the only way if we use it area
Ashok a the only way she'll have to mine ok and if you look at in an enterprise world in a private chain is going to be very fast even you can mine or you can preallocate how many others you want you can do that ok but still if you say that you know I want to eat area but I don't want to go with you know this it's ok for that also there is a way ok we can set something called gas price 0 9 without even having
any mining in mini Anitha still you can send send transaction so that is possible that is one way so other ways what you can do this you will have to take this is Aryan blockchain code and take a fork of it and basically what you'll have to do is there is a way you could bypass money so the interim mining could be bypassed ok and you all the transaction would go default ok but that is a problem so that is
concentration and not not happening do we want blockchain to be developed but we don't want this kind of oven because it doesn't make sense to avoid some kind of coins to a private key when the only has forget I want to do is create an immutable database of transactions the site so we'll have to choose up platform accordingly that if you look at the same therium platform has been taken
by JP Morgan ok and their fork date and their calling it is quorum and they were removed the centre proof of stake instead of proof of stake they have something called draught algorithm so they built rapped on top of it so that it doesn't matter that this mining and having aquarium doesn't matter ok so once you are good with ethereum platform probly can download quorum it call Quora you can download the quorum platform and start using it
I have no I'm sorry don't you but maybe I missed something if of state and proof of work I couldn't understand the difference between these two week in one we are figuring out the random no ones which is use of work and so what are we do it is different area doing in proof of stake so proof of work basically what happens is everybody can participate and then find out the puzzle proof of stake they want to make sure that only you just
show me know how was take ok suppose you should have if you want to participate in the consensus algorithm you'll have to deposit and toes and its ok so then what happens high-level what happens is there will be only a few participants who would be ready to do that and mathematically the form of Dell find out like weather whatever you are doing is right or wrong so let's not
get into it probly then after the class we can discuss show invalid JSON cannot unmarshal hex number with leading zero Sudhir can you send me the command whatever you send that is getting an error so asking a passphrase for unlocking so I don't know the past phrase all of you my dove in a given a pass prices today probly you might have given it yureka something non admin or something like
ok try with that yesterday we tried actually do Eureka 123 in Mohit machine
let me copy Sudhir is having some issue let me look at that real quick and so they probably have you created a second account
does your comment is right we are trying to send one either so let me take it your good right so let me take
Sudheesh machine that please yes we can you can you provide me access
you should have just now ok so what you are trying to do is to my account first account I just wanna tell standing send trying to send half litre you had only one either is it but why are you getting authentication ok you unlock this out now you can
send a transaction can you preserve parokiya presenter can you personal dot unlock account now you are you sure unlocking account number one but you'll have to unlock uncle from your trying to send from account zero so you'll have to unlock account number zero
ok
this is something that we created yesterday right yes ok good now is done right now is ok thank you
Shailendra what is passphrase Shailendra I don't remember yesterday we would have created on passphrase right I don't remember what you have given can you try reconnecting it or otherwise we should what we should do if we should create an hour
Naina another admin we should just. Money to the other node when to take some time ok can we create another we can create whatever your forgotten is gone that we can do we can create another past ok
if I am and ideas really asking true so that's why if you lose your private key it's gone whether you have 100 Bitcoins are thousands Bitcoins it's gone so that important it is ok so I'll just take get the gist of it so probly can read it ok not a problem it won't take much time right
Ya Allah and my name I am having two account 1441 I forgot password and second one is having zero value and I want to do the mining and put someone into that second one option for it is possible ok but you know just try it on your own because it will take some time ok
otherwise in the next question class you let me know we can figure it out now Mohit can you check the balance movie turn the rest of the team right so you have submitted the submitted the transactions ok so now can you check the balance if not get balance of account one can you go out and type
is it ok so still it is zero that's ok so there is no balance ok so now let's start the mining process started and you can see that here you know you should see some transaction inside so we are seeing zero alright so I dunno was was picked up
ok so now to eat read get balance find out whether you have got a balance on which ok that's cool so likewise like everybody should get a balance once you start mining so that's the idea so this one goes like right now we have sent transaction that is
basically be sent some either this is also transaction supposed tomorrow you are going to interact with your contract that also is a transaction so for that transaction to go through it has to get mind so that's the whole concept sorry good fine so now I am leaving the rest to you like you know whatever commands are there just maybe there is some additional commands
ok just trying out on your own and now I am going to show you something which will be useful for your project and development standpoint ok so that's not in the PDF document ok so but I am going to show you that so can we have a quick break so probly will take ur lips most of us joint by 7:30 right so we'll take a 5 minute break
ok let's regroup and I can show you like you know how real time how it works you know what is that you'll have to do for a smart contract knows you can stop the mining process if you don't require
break final break will be back then let's discuss
ok team so I am back now so I love you so what we are going to look now is so we have basically what we have done as we have created a private blockchain and found out like how to make transaction and be executed some commands and before that what we have seen as we have used this tester
is Framework all about and how do we how do we build ethereum based solution blockchain solution so that is what I am going to show you ok the Framework is called truffle fine it's a very popular Framework I think it's done by something think all consensus ok and they have partnered with MIT in a US and right now they are the frontrunner place in Dubai
Dubai there trying to build smart Dubai blockchain enabled government so lot of things are going on so there working closely in Dubai government ok so we look a look at truffle Framework so what what is the project ok I am going to upload this project it is just outline of like you know how it is going to be ok and I have not taken care of like all the conditional checks other details ok so that is up to you to complete
project UK in your from your side so the project what I have done is it called the movie cell project OK it is more or less will match in up the project which you are going to do as Land registration project little more or less match your needs ok movie cell project so basically someone would list the movie ok someone list the movie
for sale for sale offer for sale or for sale or not sell whatever it is ok and someone can buy the movie ok and there will be a simple dashboard to display what is what all the details it is ok so in your case what we are going to do and as part of project is done
land registration ok so land registration is going to be your project and what do you have to do this you will have to registered the land ok and while registering you can mention like you know how much does it cost and you list for sale list for sale you can mention like you know how much share does it cost does it
first Nokia and then you will if you just transfer the sale ok so this is what is the project ok it's a simple very simple project ok so same thing I have done with movie sale but not completely ok partially have done to give an idea of what it is and then you can take this as an example and then go ahead and do it and I am not use any rich HTML features or
you know which three men were using with 3 days but I have not gone for any node SDK or something like that you know not frame ok the reason being right so most of the team members join like they are not from JavaScript background ok so node JS and other things you will get difficult for them so what I've made is a plain HTML playing JavaScript ok and some of you guys if you are from UAE background and in a node SDK you know you should in a 500
very easy to do what you can you show your sdks node SDK Sandhu it ok should be a problem ok so this is just bad minimum Idea ok fine I hope all of you are able to see my screen right ok good so what I would do this I will be sad thing this project with you you can try it on your
ok so this Framework first I will show you how it works when I will just then I will make you do it okay make you do how to create this Framework will make you created so what I am going to do this so I go to this movie project so this project right so this is
can test using testrpc instead of going through the real blockchain we can use tester PC but the same truffle format you can either connect to tester PC or if you want you can connect to the private blockchain or if you want to connect to a public blockchain you are good to go you can do it ok so what I do is a right now I'm being in movie project ok old is God created those details I'll give you before that
so what are you doing I would do 3 comments on this truffle compile what this would do is this would compile my soul Aditi files ok so what are the solitary 5 so it will compile know it just hold on for a different question will see that the first truffle compiler's compiler contracts ok so it is contract
so what I do is I'll recompile truffle compile ok so you see that movie sale dots on this the solitary file which I'm trying to compile ok and there is something called migrations that's all this is for the Framework itself OK nothing to do with have not written any code on this movie is soul and that someone forget about it okay sweater
how much was the gas used transaction details all those things you can see status simulator ok so next staples truffle build this is for you I under contract to get enough for both of it to work so we used by and call truffle build ok this is also done now what I need to do is sleep
download movie project test 200 I go to build folder in the Builder I am opening this index.htm
ok so this is another HTML page in a RC mention its up to you like and I can create fancy and I did not take that time so that you know its I'll walk you through the code also so first I am going to register some movie showing your case it will be a land registration ok so movie names
my favourite movie show cost around s100 so the account number is 08123 646 223 you can add in this drop down box all the stuff you can Ok so now what are you do I click on register movie it has created a transaction this is the transaction
what is the time 9890 089 002 so this is the transaction website ok so now what will do will get the list of movie ok so when you get the list of movie from where it is switching it is fetching from blockchain ok so what is the owner address what is the movie name cost what is the status of the movie sale status like whether it is true meaning that it is allowed for sale you can beautiful it okay UK
add style sheets beautiful it don't look at that and beautification but look at what is happening right now is when you click on register movie it is in fact directly talking with your blockchain Memon testrpc and makes a transaction OK when you get movie it is going to the blockchain and finds out what is that and then displays it here ok so high level before going into the code any questions
ok so no questions fine so that it is Jason
Jason has got especially so if this is movie is getting registered as a block ideal is speaking like many transactions should should go inside a block ok but since this is a simulator what will happen is everything will go inside a block ok each transaction is getting inside a block make sense but ideal world it's not like that many transaction go inside a block yeah so just let me know if you have enough
Aadu 2 on YouTube I am good let me know someone wants to speak when Jago it move it so sweet I am ok just RPC is ethereum blockchain basically which they don't you don't even have to spin up multiple nodes and create a blockchain you can just contest IPC and that's a great now how are you talking to this is static HTML file it is just using that
behind the scenes to talk to the blockchain would you be sharing this quote with her so you're the only way I would be sharing this quote with you and sucrafil is ICICI account inside the transaction the acid that you're trying to interact with
that acid should not be a part of the smart contract I mean I cannot just even I cannot just simply go and buy any movie because I cannot just make up a movie name and buy it right movie has to be there in released in somebody has to ignore the way we have all like if I am developing an enterprise based system I would have a look up kinda thing over uniform doing a property based system I would have a list of properties to choose from Chennai so that is
full full scale project right so this is just to get an idea like an overview like how things works in terms of connecting things ok if I have HTML5 JavaScript what is that I need to do so how is that I am facing from a solid ITI base contract when you find this register movie you are basically creating a movie available for sale so you are basically creating a new property all we basically
getting a new movie that now somebody can actually go and crafts for 100 years to the account address 0x 123 and they would get the ticket of your song Rita Shawshank Redemption is that is crazy so this is like creating a look up and now your basically I see there should be one there should be one more module actually so the
more modulus unit Transfer now you see the registration part of it ok then there should be a transfer where you can transfer and you'll have to do all those conditions like whether the transfer that money is ok and all those details so all of that in Gurgaon inside solidity files to make sure and its would I be like ok sure once once I see the code thank you
also the corner Palm Sunday question from Sudhir construction is a Framework that's right is it on developers machine or unknown unknown Chennai developers machine if you want to utilise this Framework ok can you said you have to install this truffle software and then you can reply it so can truffle deploy and public key chain as well yes it can suck
meaning of memory using truffle as a Framework for deploying was know how you once again there is a question from how user will be able to access private network so that is supposed in our group right so we all have so we all have created a private change all of us if we all connect together people can access it so you'll have to exposed that
yes this is my blockchain this is my network ID and if you exposed to the outside world they can connect on the Nexus yeah thats thats Rachel and I are going with what if I don't want to I mean what if I don't want to use testrpc but actual blockchain running on my this week so right now there is one node running and you are you man
is talking about that you can spin off multiple nodes by just giving multiple directories in multiple ports correct so I can build up multiple node blockchain within my local machine yes you can do that and so which port no 8545 is would not be available because the only put we saw was 30 30 something like that put right so will I be connecting while starting
what happens while you start your getinstance ok so we use very basic commands ok let me show you when we started get get we use data directory and some basic options ok but if you go deep dive there are many options we can mention the no not this time but there is a RPC port you can
Gana Bala ji can enable different ports using this command line options I say so first you have to enable the stdp RPC server then you have to do then you can connect to this blockchain that's right ya its every node can expose its own its own Tote I'll try to run talk to this one let's see if we can try that
find out Lord of the missing pieces so most of this course right so most of it like in a first for class is it all went in theory actually so right now we are getting into too much of practicals thank you so much so there is another question that's right you are right question from Sudhir why was the gas notes
justified in the example is it hard coded so you mean with example when we send Ether from one person to another person movie so movie know we have used gas I can show you it is inside the code so and there was another question from you more than I can I use metamask to connect to my local right so you can do that you can connect is only 5
RTC port enabled and uncracked that's right yeah ok fine ok now I'll let you walk you through the code and the Framework how it works
benefits applying
ok
Kis Kis inside this folder is where all my stuff is ok so this is no 11th this app.js and index latest email first we will look at the contract folder ok if you feel so right one is migrations that's all and other one is a movie sale.com
so this is the solidity contract with everything ok to chill simple like 50 lines of code ok so this I got all the details whatever you have done ok the movie registration ok and movie sale all this OK get movie details all this study this Ahir latest look at 11
Santosh movie sale so far is what I am doing inside create a structure I guess who is the owner of the movie I got it ok make sense so this details EAMCET October that is what is movie is a life
don't like weather this person has initiated the same amount of cost I am listed suppose I were listed hundred ethers easy transfer 100 100 episode basic conditions can we chat here and then this expose outside to the HTML page ok but you can do it this just a prototype for you to know create land registry project and similarly you have this get movie list it will I know that is what is showing
user display what are the account address details and stuff like that ok just mentioning voice is breaking how would others are you also feeling the same tym k ok voice is breaking right ok so everyone
Friday is it better now ok so now it is fine right ok fine so this is the structure ok once again I repeated this work this is a folder structure in this first I want to show you the contract folder so there is a contract folder within which I can see that there is a solid 85 ok so this already the file is nothing but movie sale dates all similarly you will have to create
ldt file called land registration ok so all the methods like the first one what we do from the UAE we do register movie in a couple of things we do register movie did movie on top of that you'll have to have enable something like movie sell option right so for register movie this is the method ok in solidity level this is a method and forget movies this
as simple as get and set ok and this is a movie sale where we sex imbalance whether he has right balance or not and then the movie gets transferred should be a state or the ownership get transferred from one person to another by the smart contract ok so this is about it ok so on
migrations got this is for a truffle Framework so do not worry about this this has to stay as is ok this the migrations not solve has to stay as this is just a Framework file so I think my voice is breaking let me re join
meet right the reason just give me a sec
oriel able to hear me and see my screen ok fine let me explain and then take a questions ok so this is one this is the contract folder the next one is there is enough
since I've created one is register movie and other one is load movie UK for you I so basically right what we do is registered movie we need to get all these details whatever we enter in your way so and then hit on register EPF register movie button onclick of Register movie button all we do is Ok you no call this instance this movie registration which is in the solid ITI contract ok how this
called this is called via web three.js ok so this is the this movie sale dot deployed that then you have written here right so what happens is one moment you deploy your contract in contract name instant this God created ok so that is movie sealed or diploid will give you that instance so using that you can call this Aditi contract suppose if it was the hardware support
she don't use truffle Framework what we need to do is will have to deploy the contract we should maintain the API JSON and all other details and we'll have to do it manually ok so that is what trouble Framework is helping us here movie registration and whatever details it was here and I think Sudhir was asking me we didn't pass any gas ok so I see here I passed gas here
this is a transaction paper minimum amount of gas make sense this is a simple JavaScript ok so you can go through this and the next 1 days I will show you the HTML page is also very simple ok it doesn't have anything all it has is not the heading of it and it has some text boxes and the submit button
make sense so this simple HTML so any questions on the Framework aspect of it so where do you put your code should be here any questions
so don't see any questions so what is the sequence of law will go on to that okay sequence of flow will go into it sure before that so this is about it up and there are other folders so all your UI related and JavaScript will go and said app folder ok so your build
whatever we do right when we do a truffle build so the artefacts everything is developed here and it's here index.htm also this is where you'll have to get started and contract can contains contract folder so this migration again this one right so what will happen is this is a Framework file ok so what if you look at here here is where you can say that what is that you want to deploy
ok so what is your here you see what I said is I'll have to compile resale dots all suppose you are you want to compile three different solidity files and this is the place you have so movie sale again you're welcome something here something here and all this is done in the deploy contract that this ok and then you do this the command to deploy OK when you do a truffle migrate this is
kids deploy ok and the last one is test and if you are good at this cucumber script or more 6 scripts you can utilise this test framework to write out details okay testing scripts ok for our project I don't think we require test scripts ok
we are not we are writing code in vs code where is truffle Framework not Rahul Framework will have to install I haven't shown you that we are opening the folder in vs code OK so the last one so this is a very important piece ok so here you find something called ruffled at JS here is where you can mention
I'm here you should have mentioned that it has to be here if you want to if you want to deploy in private chain ok so probly we can call another parameter call private and if you want to make it to production OK then you can call production ok us where you define where it has to go ok and I really what happens when you do it
full migrate OK when you execute command call to upgrade you can say development ok so this will take you to a development in mind when you say truffled migrate production this will. To the production environment so all that so min we have not set it right so this is where you have to set it up ok make sense case any questions
now what I want you to do is let us try this truffle Framework UK the same project ok so you do it and not your free times until next week you have time so what you do is we can I will show you that what is that you'll have to install after installing I'll ask you to create some folders so that you know that you have
Framework ok in the meantime I will give you this movie project so you deployed in your machine and try out whether you are able to navigate and do the same functionality that you are able to register movie get movie if you are good till there then it is a matter of you know you learn this and registration crack ok make sense
yes yes tellen ok so now I'll tell you like to important thing is right install this version of TOEFL only 3.4.9 select pass on the command OK what happens is the even I have not tried in the environment in the corporate world Vienna
profile framework of the reason being you know we are using we want to go the hard way so we have built our own framework so I don't know what has happened with Ruffle Framework recently so just let us go with this version ok install truffle 3.4.9
so anybody good at 10 p.m yes I can take care of it you can tell what is the command exactly npm ok this is a 1000 like friends at the rate you're not
I think you are busy so I am passing on this command everybody ok so try to install only this version 14 and I don't have I have dealt with those versions so if there is some error in a will have to look deep dive into it so let's use this version only so can you all pick list
I think I always take your machine so you can show like a number
sorry can you install this and find out I know the next command try truffle version and find out what is the version of it
other stuff ok if you have done can you please let me know like a rock Vikas or know if you face any difficulties let me know
so done ok so now can you all I know in some folder ok create a folder called in KDA as I'm testing something like that some folder of your choice and CD into the folder
can you clear loans your window so now so being in this project the first command we are going to execute is truffle in it its centre
what does is it will download the default project and if all there is something called metacoin so if you want you can go through this project also so it downloads that project for your sunao type LS specific ltr
enter ok you can see that you have a test folder created migration contracts apart from this what do you have to do is in career creator app folder should come in but for some reason app folder ok now do a truffle compile
and now do you can just 2 year in open tester PC and beautiful migrate open another terminal window and do our truffle migrate
ok basically we don't have anything to truffle build OK so the next come
btpl little bit but we don't have the UI related files ok so now all of you I believe if you can do till here it means that you have installed Ruffle you can we are able to in a basically do some compilation of a contract and deploying the contract ok so what I'm going to do it I am going to send you this movie project try to in a first put the files in and accordingly do or do a truffle compile
migrate and build OK then find out then you find out whether you are able to do it ok if you can then you can build a movie project I'm in line project on top of it ok by default I don't think so we have which are you looking for Visual Studio code so I think by default it's not installed
what is installed but its not in the path I think how is it installed ok
ok is any questions to here so probly at the end of the class I will try to upload this movie projector can try out come next week and discussion with edureka and the additional classes ok will be
but I'll let you know the dates next week when we meet ok this app folder does not have anything that is ok that is fine II you create you create one when I give you the movie project you try to copy the files whatever's person in the app folder
where to copy the files ok let me take my machine
so if you look at here I am going to send you this the Wipro The Other zip file ok so what you can find all this year so you just remove this
Choi if you go inside this test you can see this app ok so just we place whatever you gotta have install truffle framework now just replaced with the contents whatever I am giving you if I been not replace also just go inside this folder and said this test folder and new feud waterfal compile you will be able to do the full compile truffle build truffle migration truffle build okay make sure that you start tester PC
ok Sudhir dedicated others others fine Shailendra
truffle compile pointing to download it doesn't matter neutrophil come will you be in that directory and start computer do it awful company is not pointing to downloads directory in you can choose your own directory path ok so now it is 9:40 let's take
wait for 5 minutes ok 94 940 rides will take a break and then will while we meet will start with the new topic OK will look at hyperledger the next platform and before that if you have any questions we can figure out that questions and then start with hyperledger ok ok
no surrender I'm not sad the code I will be sharing it at the end of the class ok to take couple of hours for you to get the code
ok team that looks like Sudhir your having question right I have a question on generally transaction should I am YouTube
world no I don't remember exactly but there is one more from work starts with something g n a i l WhatsApp you ok with that transaction where you said the gas limit and the wallet address and all those things that's true for
itarium China as well why I'm asking that is a many many of the ICU so many of the apps that exist on blockchain with example Crypto kitties of things like that they make people putting the gas they make people go through the metamask wallet so if it can be automated wanted be good for end users to the one you showed us the example the movie won the end use
for the end user the implementation was hidden blockchain implementation but in the real world that's not true I'm in application make and users put in all this data write the gas limit the wallet at the reason why is because the gas limit if you see it is not a fix it limit ok ok so that is there is a gas cost ok so for each
no of course there is a gas cost and another gas limit is set by the network and it fluctuates on the difficulty level ok how much transaction currently network has if the transactions are enormous ok let's say that there is a millions of transaction in the network which is all in a pending state to go through ok so at that time network automatically adjust and setter higher gas price Okay suppose if you want to send one either for you just for the sake of exam
Sophie want to send you one either you need to send. 5 vs gas just imagine like that ok and if we calculate that automatically it will be problem for user UK so as a user I am not bothered like you know whether I sent this one tomorrow to my friend or after a week ok if it can wait so in that case so that is why you have the gas user is measuring the gas how much he wants to
send us the gas in gas price today then it was a 6 gas price is very high so I won't do any transaction today I can do tomorrow but if I make it automated it should not be a surprise for me that I know I send one either and. 5 others has gone messages ok so any other question guys
can we move on to hyperledger ok so I'm taking so what I'm going to do a seminar at the end of the class I will upload this movie project so normally where you can find is enough find out in the course content OK go to the 7th model today is 7
8th class right ya so find out in the 8th class should be able to find it okay make sense somewhere and the files we should be able to find the Inn at the end of it you can find file section where you can find this movie project have seen that Mini for some reason if I upload from my Windows what is happening I will try to do it from Ubuntu only what happens is by default the file gets
zipped and also compressed try to do if it is opening ok let's not do a WinZip ok try to do a gunzip it it'll work okay team so let's MT hyperledger so infact first portion of it is going to be theory so next probly next week we look at the practical Pizza Hut
so why hyperledger before that know what is the problem with ethereum why do we need a different platform so I getting most of you had this question in mind OK so for example I think Sudhir and Mohit Tyagi devar mentioning like we should I send something called gas ok in the private network ok I am going to develop something for enterprise why I guess whenever he should I spend some transaction fee
I guess your transaction fee ok and this is the next next question is why is there a mining this proof of work mining this is a headache for enterprise right and why is there a cryptocurrency at all why there is a cryptocurrency OK so these are all some underlying concepts or me no problems with the ethereum or Bitcoin was blocked
Sunita out like you know this won't shoot the enterprise need and we need something more on top of it so that's why this platforms like hyperledger fabric came into existence so there is another problem with ethereum right to one major problem ok why do we need even customers you know they have this question in mind and probably I'll explain that why we need a different machine first of all if their name is just a private network and no
permission network OK it is only private if you want to make it permission do you need to write the code and make it permission ok so for example meaning what what it means is so you all know about public I am not talking about private ok so now latest take private let us take a car manufacturing company ok soap manufacturing lipstick BMW ok and their by parts from different
by parts across different vendors and then they assemble BMW so that is what is happening so what happens they want all there when does to be part of the blockchain ok for example now this is vendor event urbandesi let's take a turing machine example ok so they have a smart contract called when does not contract OK when does smart control I'll say that we
smart contract c o KVS is a smart contract what happen in the aquarium world is everyone gets a copy of this contract whether they like it or not everyone gets a piece of the smart contract ok and it store and if you want to send some transaction whether you like it or not all the participants get the transaction even though they cannot open the transaction see what has happened
they would still be able to in this smart contract is all by its ok even bytecode so from this week and find out what is the smart contract what is the rules have been returned and all the transaction we can find out who is sending transaction to whom all the things can be found out from here ok so even though you are using a is Aryan private chain so this this is another problem this is the fourth problem ok so it is not real
permission ok so everyone gets a copy and this headache for the enterprise not permission ok so these were the problems hyperledger is trying to address ok fine I'll be good till here ok next what is hyperledger who are
contributors to hyperledger platform will look at that ok so they thought like the enterprise thought that we are good with a blockchain concept the concept is really good ok though they want to go mainstream but they can't go with the existing platforms so they can't choose Bitcoin or ethereum as a platform and I even though ethereum does a lot of things ok so they can't use it as is for enterprise world so for enterprise world JP Morgan what they are doing us
some examples I can give you so JP Morgan is taking it area Mesa platform ok and their modifying it to their their needs and their calling it is quorum ok so ur hair cutting down all the proof of work and other details similarly for Magenta think it's Pfizer ok bye Sir they are also taken it area Mesa platform ok
and they are trying to build something called medilaser ok so this one not typically is used for the Pharma Industry ok but it area measure platform their taking foking the ethereum platform in trying to eliminate or create this permission features and other stuff like that ok switch call middle ages is quorum so and in a very good thing about it is so if you know ethereum platform
would hardly take a week or two for you to go through this to platforms ok so you can find you can download quorum and then find out I know what is going on in simplest and the ornament gold medal is quorum the advantage what you get is so hear what I mentioned is when you make a transaction when you make a transaction from A to B so the same transaction goes to everybody everybody knows that what happened ok in the quorum world if you send a transaction from
B2B and if you Mark as private ok so there is a way you can make the transaction private so that you know that doesn't get propagated to see that is all features has been added in Korum this only private transaction we can do that you can quorum so likewise middle aged I haven't gone through so now what is hyperledger fourths of it
hyperledger yes Foundation ok so they want to create a blockchain platform solution for the enterprise so they wanted to it is basically a Linux Foundation project locate comes under Linux Foundation ok so they are building this project and under this project they want to make sure that all the source code here is open source ok so anyone can participate and you're not weak the court make
Indus it's all fine you know you can do it it's all open source ok so here there are being there are multiple in multiple people are there is a project under this there are different platforms one platform is called hyperledger fabric ok so this one incubated by IBM and other partners was also there but almost 85% of the code base is developed by
even though it is open source IBM contributes a lot ok and pushing for this fabric all the Demos they perform to the customers on alright so it's all via hyperledger fabric then another popular platform is called hyperledger sawtooth LIC so this is but enough
even though hyperledger fabric it's been pushed alot ok so there are some problems with fabric so it is made to Complex actually is not that easy as it came to start a node there are lot of certificates and other details which has to be followed ok so people some be summer saying that 10 of fabric is dumb to failure but you never know what is going to happen but industry why there is a very good Puspa hyperledger fabric and saw tool
let me know that is so people call you now it's going to be TY BMS fabric ok so this is developed by Intel ok again open source major contribution is Intel so here in till what they do is there same distributed platform blockchain platform what they do is along with this there building some hardware capability I don't know if you could remember our second class UK where we discuss the
different in a proof of different types of consensus algorithm so they have something called SGX plus tax software extension Framework ok so I don't know how do they are what they are doing is apart from blockchain they are building a special trip where its called eating Enclave ok so
where you can execute the piece of code inside the Enclave ok so that will give you more security so that is what hyperledger is coming up ok so this is Intel platform then there are other platforms like hyperledger borrow hyperledger Indy is one has an hour trying to solve a purpose ledger in the and there something called
iroha OK so the popular ones are the first to Fabric and short ok ok so any questions till now
yeah we will we look good we look and do it one by one ok so so high level this is what it is OK what is bro what is Hindi Indies for identity borrowed have taken fabric will come to those lights ok but for now what I want you to understand is why we need such a promise and blockchain environment
so will look at all these 30 days will look ok so so traditional so this is an example like like you know what is a traditional Network and a blockchain network so ke traditional at work what hap
there is always a intermediately you work with and also everyone maintain their own version of truth that is there on database and they act with it so suppose if you take Airlines so all the most of the bookings goes wires and the summer days there is some system right so with it goes with Amber days and things like that and I recently read an article that Expedia and other expedient priceline
remove the enter a 85 percentage of Ireland bookings comes we are in a it's only North America North America United States 85% of transport booking when airline booking scum via Expedia or priceline so they both become they have become a big giant ok which airline industry wants to solve the mostest Avenue goes in a goes to them so all the of
girls in fact no one no books ticket from the airlines itself because this if you look at the expiry and they have this rewarding reward points and other details and they make it easy for the user but behind the scenes what is happening is this airline industry has to pay a lot of commission and they take use cut ok so they want to solve this things through blockchain so when you look at blockchain everyone shares the
same copy of truth so that's why it's all intralink ok so this is just an example so what happens is if you look at here so the problem right so what they mentioned is everyone has a his own copy of data ok so party de party a some examples they are meeting their own version of ledger it is a distributed ledger so everyone is
having their me know what's up unified copy of ledger with some basic permissions like who has to see what like that ok so we are blockchain will change the way we do business right so so ideas so everyone is allowed to say the truth inside the blockchain that is like once used as a statement once you commit that yes
for example latest take this automobile as an example ok in automobile world suppose if you want to introduce the brake shoe ok you are sending a brake shoe to BMW what you are saying is you are entering the serial number that no serial number 001 ok so this is shipped by me and I use my private key to sign the transaction so later point of time I can't say that no it was not from me ok so that this the whole we have this distributed
distributed single version of truth which is changing the world so what are the number one highly efficient distributed so its all day efficiency in terms of efficiency so people say highly efficient but still it is we are not there it so recently added an article that ripple has overtaken visa
if you look at the transactions right so the number of transactions it is like before two three weeks it was in a visa which can do a lot of transactions per second okay but right now I have seen an article that has overtaken that but you know they are not full temporary production it so they have tasted it and they could make much faster transactions then then visa ok so we are not there yet
but we are working towards it ok so next one is certification of contract so right now all the contract if you look at all the credit card contacts Oliver loan contracts is all paper written contract so even though we signed it digital it's not there in terms of code OK what has to happen anybody can file an amendment and change it right so it's not the case with smart contract so
so that is the qualification of contracts with these all will enable more trust so next US since this is going to be distributed in a it will enable more participants more open Ness and other things ok so trust wise it will be very good to have blockchain place so what is blockchain for business is why I don't want to
in a get into Motihari so the idea is it solve distributed and you can develop to know if you look at a database OK what happens to people in the database if you want to make a transaction ok if you want to enter something or if you want to delete something from database all you need to know is if you have that database privilege you can go and Dumper transaction and if you want to delete it all you need is the permission if you have that integrity if you are an
administrator you can do whatever you want right no one is going to question and no one is going to know until maybe we install some in some software tools to track but still it is a very difficult job but what happens with the distributed database it's not that easy it's not possible at all because it is immutable once you send a transaction it gets distributed distributed everybody and there is a consensus in place ok which take care of it ok that is what they've try
communicate here so any question guys clear ok so what is hyperledger NIC mentioned it is a non profit in open source community founded by Linux Foundation show hosted by Linux Foundation ok and so they are trying to build their main motion 9
their ideology is to build a blockchain for business ok blockchain for enterprise so that is what their focused upon and should be open anybody can participate remain immune to Commercial interests of any a single company but generally speaking right I don't know if you guys know about this person this Bitcoin I think his name is and prepare something Bitcoin
and throw this person right so he talks a lot about Andreas antonopoulos there is a community Enterprise in all the stuff ok but if you believe blockchain
won't open nurse they don't want to go for distributed stuff even though we learn platforms button has a saying when people say that go for public platform at least you know make some transaction by some either send try to buy a coffee with either that's of the blockchain community hall wants to do it the reason being as simple as if you look at 2009 crash into the
9 crash on earth 2008 Chrysler Saleem and brothers and other bank both got collapse lately members and water Merrill Lynch right so they both got collapse what happened Hoover had accounts in their bank it was last rites and I don't know that should be some mechanism that required but what happened was all the United States taxpayers fund was given back to them so that their home at least they could
make sure you know it is the fault with bank but no taxpayers money was given back to them not to save themselves so that's why enough people say that in a let's go public then let's go to public blockchain if you want to have a fund 16year blockchain ok and if you today what is happening if you have funds in your bank Samundar bank is taking that funds and then a lens that has an interest and that is it goes right but when it's a public blockchain nothing can be done
that we have fun sits with you so this and I just want to share the general what people think OK so the next one is industry standard blockchains in enterprise ready they're trying to create support for different level of access meaning that so if you want to in if you are hosting environment blockchain environment you can against
access privileges like administrator what he can access or if he is a General pure water can access role based access you can sit here and so theyre trying to develop cross chain transaction this is one week big break through which needs to happen in blockchain currently if you look at here look at you cannot transfer funds from Ether to Bitcoin right so this is a separate blockchain Network and that is a separate blockchain network how to have between change
ok so many are working towards it so that's going to be a very big big breakthrough and last one is modularity what is modularity is between because when means so right now if you go with ethereum you have no choice you'll have to go with proof of stake proof of work right but in hyperledger fabric you can pick and choose what is the algorithm you'll have to you want to use ok so that's the beauty of modularity
source name is Andrea Santa Claus so Andreas antonopoulos in fact he wrote the first to mastering Bitcoin book it came back in 2013 or 2014
ok so what all the advantages we get with fabric it is a permission membership so now if you look at Atrium blockchain anybody can participate in the chain so no one is stopping you from joining racing but where as
in February se permission membership only if you have permissions you can join rich queries so if you look at a buddy for drink this uses coach TV and you can use level 2 be both you can use you can like how if you look at it is blockchain you can do a basic get and functionalities but here you can have rich queries ok can get multiple details you can run reports
profit lot of things you can do whatever this enterprise world needs rates all those things can be done so question how is modular architecture different from smart contract right so so modular architecture Rasoi smart contract a smart contract here in fact fabric world is called as chaincode ok smart countries is equal testing code so it is both one and the same
but in ethereum if you want if you want to disable proof of work and if you want to choose proof of stake you can't do it ok until unless you go modify the code ok it's that difficult to do it it's not that easy but when you come to Fabric it is not the case if you want pbst algorithm you can choose it if you want draught algorithm you can choose it if you want some other consensus algorithm you can plug and play
it is just as easy as it yeah that's right I'm also modular rack architecture and any protection of digital keys so it's all in a this is there in the public chain also and performance scalability performance is very good thing in in terms of fabric Ok why because if you look at 8 a.m.
public chain public it takes at least for now they are claiming that lightning Network and plasma could solve the another performance characteristics but we are not there yet so when you look at fabric it's only in between organisation they are trying to use this Kakka Kakka consumer producer that I don't know if you came across khas khas khas
but I'm messaging service ok so they are trying to use this kafka messaging service in fact LinkedIn uses in Big Data world ride in Big Data world LinkedIn uses LinkedIn in fact created that kafka so there using it so that lot of transaction can process in a second okay performance is one of the major criteria for fabric Sewing enterprise world no one would wait like innocent some transaction and wait for 50
that's not going to happen yesterday so hyperledger goals She Goes again like it same story again some facts to create an enterprise grid UK which is used for enterprise Robert and stuff like that and number 2 it is open source
ok and basically they are trying to create a ecosystem for enterprise that is a major goal for next 1 days problems with this one is important problems with existing blockchain ok we consider Italian world OK what is happening is no privacy OK I will take from important things else no privacy so all that
section the smart contracts everyone knows what is a smart contract is and transaction people know that who has send what transaction to whom even though they don't know the identity they know that some transaction there is no privacy and this is designed for cryptocurrency for sending money and stuff like that so that is what is design for me it cannot handle the enterprise use case suppose you want to track the supply chain
Pharma scenario in that case it will be difficult not designed for it and poor governance see if you want to Innocence is a public change very difficult to make change in the running stream suppose it's all up and running suppose if you want to make a change you love to fix a time you'll have to forget and the entire community has to follow the four ok solve problems are here
Limited throughput recently I think Sudhir as mentioned about the Crypto kitties so what have happened is there was I have call Crypto kitties you can buy cat in virtual cancer basically can buy cats using ethereum platform so what happened that interceptor kitties net app congested the entire ethereum network so there is a good problem transactions are slow
so next one is anonymous like we don't know like who it is it's all identity is all anonymous and I don't know I don't agree with that no settlement finality settlement happens on the real time I don't know why you what the mean by no settlement finality just leave it I'll confirm this one ok no settlement finality
so this is so they were presented in a different way create an enterprise grade open source provide need neutral okay bill technical community is what all there doing ok so from metal I can you chat they have support community and really trust me guys hyperledger fabric also working with it but I know the ethereum communities way great men why you if you ask any questions or to their Foundation member
you get immediate response ok or at least within a day you get a response fabric is like you know it's all hidden if you ask post some difficult question it will take really long time to get answers from the technical communities educate public opportunity and diesel basic goals of them now so we'll look at what
the famous available whatever what is that we look at that just give me a quick quick I'll be back in 2 minutes just give me a sec
ok sunpack so hyperledger modular umbrella approach so you basically if you see here this is Linux Foundation write the Linux Foundation has lot of initiatives some of them are called in a cloud foundry node JS ok they have this open container what is it kubernetes
tools like hyperledger Explorer what is the Explorer like how we look at it the Explorer right we locate the blocks and the transaction similarly we have hyperledger Explorer what happened to the transfer transaction details you can go back and see like what happened and hyperledger composer like how you have this remix solidity right so how you can simply easily write code and applied likewise you have for this hyperledger composer tool wear in which you
and write the code and then deployed ok so this composer tool and there is something call Salo Salo is for sale in Italy on world if you want to spin up 5:30 I'm not ok and if you go to Azure like a cloud platform you can select like how many notes you would like to spin up and it will automatically create a change for you take a private Chennai convention the network ID and stuff like that it would do for you similarly there is a platform colleges seller tool
on which you can spin up multiple nodes and make a connection between the so that is a psychologist still OK so the next one is hyperledger scope of project scope and what they want to do and what is that they don't want to so first one is custom application so that is up to the user like you know they are not going to build any apps on top of it all their going to do is develop APS expose AP
and give you the platform and infrastructure so that our users we can build custom applications according to your organisation meets or whatever needs we have based on that we can build on top of it so these are the things they work on Ok also wonders III ledger so the underlying the blockchain piece so the entire infrastructure setting up and how do we propagate blocks all those the core part they develop apart from that they developed the libraries so that
we can interface with that an internet based on our application application needs any question guys here are we good to hear ok I take it EZ
sunnext is hyperledger architecture so how it is ok how would architectural style explain separately so we're looking at membership services we look at blockchain chaincode so we look at consensus is one
find it will look at the architecture so this is important please OK
first we look at this membership services as you can see here this is all a logical structure OK it is it is a logically how it is group you know if you look for is there a peer to peer protocol separate layer no does not like that ok logical assumption first I'll talk to you about the membership services membership services is the core and very confusing part of login
hyperledger fabric OK what is this membership services so in Italian world what do you get if you get up public key and private key right you get a public and private key so with this you make all the transactions right so that's what is happening you get a account address now you are trying to do that in a personal dot new account or get the count new all it does is it creates account is nothing but a public and private key here in in the world
hyperledger fabric similarly instead of public private key you have something called in the same concept but you have something called certificates ok so love you right so if you have worked in http https you all know that there is a certificate involved if you are visiting some website ok so what happens is it downloads that certificate in your machine I hope all of you know
that right ok Shailendra CCS but I hope all of you are aware of it at least so ja when you log into your side certificate so hyperledger what they are doing is there trying to use the same certificate mechanism OK where and which you get a certificate you you get a certificate and you get a private key along with at the instant they don't call it as a public private key
it is based on a private key and certificate suppose you get a certificate from again when you look at the certificate today there are many certificate companies right there we have something called very saying we have something called CA signed certificate error many authorities who gives you this certificate right so how they give as they give you know it will be some Random numbers along with that there will be a private key associated with it so only you
this private key you can unlock this certificate right also we're getting ok So Ja So this is based on this certificate so unlike this public private key elliptical curve they are using in a hypervisor is using the membership services it's nothing but the certificate and private key mechanism for why we need this is because if you look at
ethereum world anybody can join into the chain ok so suppose I'm going for it I will complete it take an automobile supply chain has a use case okay BMW will take is a manufacturer and he buys parts from different vendors so that's going to be of use case ok so when we take bmws engine manufacturer and he wants to add break vendor ok and other owners
Govinda ok so we like these are the two things a he wants to add in the network ok if they he wants them to be added as part of network what he does is he issues certificates ok Information Network so BMW himself issue certificate that was your certificate is this one okay certificate x** whatever it is and therefore same thing with this tire
company has issues this is your certificate ok and you get the private key along with that so that is owned by the break vendor ok BMW doesn't know about their private keys ok so basically these are certificates which are issued to the break vendor and that I went so when they want to interact with the blockchain interact with this BMW private or permission chain in the fabric hyperledger fabric change they have to use the certificate
to send transaction in Italy on world what happens if we send a transaction from the account address okay you remember when we did the transfer a feature from one person to another we mentioned what is from and what is 2 okay likewise here it is based on your certificate so that is it and so this membership services and whenever you look at fabric you you know think it is always modular applicable ok so why pluggable is
because so this one your company right so this your company might you see a certificate ok other company mein you something called verisign ok or some other company could you something else Ok and Fabric itself provide something call fabrics ok so it is plug and play according to your organisation needs if you go if you want to go with verisign is plug and play you can use
verify certificate you want to go with fabric say yes I also provide that if you don't have a certificate mechanism if you want to go with fabric CA yes I give you that so that modular it is but ideas so each one would be issued certificate so that this is going to be their account address or identity for making all the transactions are we clear any questions
so does membership Service also include integration to ldap on TDS or just one she probably if there is a existing so if you use suppose you have the certificate yoga and its already used in the your ldap system so then it is fine you can you
the same certificate ok but do you create a brand new certificate and if you want to tie up with existing ldap that's a different scenario ok so that is based on the use case needs and what is that your organisation is using right now so most like one participant one certificate then that's going to be a private key that's right yes
ok so this I don't see any questions for me all clear Rakesh Sudhanshu Shri Subhash fukin Anand Jason are we all good ok fine
ok so this is all about membership services ok so question so in case of https the windows machine route Store has roots Store has the issues certificates that's right how is this should be validated ok so validation red probly there is a very good you are and let me share that with you guys we can
you can go through so basically how old is validated its basic in a public and private key you sign something with your supposed in a Boat question is different in Case of Identity it so in case of ethereum public blockchain we can generate as many as per public-private combination we want to in this case we can generate as we can get as many as identities
defecate we want to formed from the issue a because issue a would be responsible for confirming my identity that I am Mohit basically yes but how is the but right now in case of ethereum we don't have to there is no identity with everything is anonymous kind of so I don't need to validate that this person is this right but in case of enterprise blockchain like hyperledger
would need to validate that the set the certificate has been issued by this issue or right of your company is only going to be an issue or ok so that you'll have to have some audit regulations and complaints like suppose if you know you want to supply lecture verisign give me a certificate ok won't be the possibility that when I sign a transaction with that certificate
at that time not only the validate that I have signed the transaction because of the sea using them my public key they will be able to decrypt it but still they also be checking that this this is being issued correctly by verisign is good I am whatever I am do so I am representing verisign also did say hey he is the right person can I think you are going but I think
about https world rates of that is a wood work so we know its not when you send when you look at open their site Ok so intern very send communicates yes you are looking at the right website it is suggested that sort of thing right so you're not going to do that process so all we do is get the certificates from the certification company
so they will give us the public haha ok ok ok fine so this is about membership services OK so the next 1 days so like voter registration service identity me know what
all things are compromise what all things compromises this membership services so you can replace the store so basically another been option where you can create a certificate that will be audited and stuff like that ok so the ideas this one whatever you explain to the next one is hyperledger architecture ok so here
what happens if so let me explain that they were consensus and smart contract ok ok so let me explain how old is fabric world when you look what is happening yes this is more of fundamental like what is fabric and what is this ok so I'm just driving and showing you like what
happening and what are the different entities ok if you look at this is first we have looked that for membership services in the next 1 days the architecture or the underlying infrastructure of like in how this blockchain is arrange how it works so if you look at fabric ok so there are different
entities which comprise is a blockchain network ok ok so this one you can call of the heart of blockchain ok and this is prone to single if order a goes down here blockchain goes down and do is we can initiate multiple orders orders ok you can
start like 10 or 20 order something like that so that it doesn't go down but only if you look at the real blockchain in in mind when everyone is appear same Peer okay whether it be a full not or not you can do all stuff here entity is a order and then you have ears also like this it is arranged ok so let's take that BMW server example
ok so BMW Sarkar he wants the network someone has to on the network its appear BMW owns the this manufacturing network so here then be introduced by default you need to send it is to work with fabric so one entity is called order the role of order address when some transaction is sent to the network order performs the ordering and then sends back to the pairs ok so basic
validation and distribution is taken care by order ok validation and distribution vnl vnb so again this is a problem ok when you look at fabric so this is one of the bottleneck they are facing right now because order is overloaded ok this one process is doing a lot of work what is peer ok so here is nothing but
another set of node you like how we see full load and light no tried so this is another type of node ok so this node what you can do with it can send transaction you cannot order you can send transaction receive transactions and it can simulate transactions simulation I'll come to simulation later ok
this all things Pierce can do ok and in here again there are different pairs ok 1 days Indore Sabir and other want to see comet appear one is endorser and other one is committed ok so these all are the different types of Noddy have in dosa committed order
but then you have membership services and ok so let's say that this is our network is arranged ok let's say that this is in Germany ok 1 part manufacturers in so let's see us India and UK
ok so like this we have different pairs connected there all vendors ok so this is how the network is a range problem Gemini will also have been here ok there inbuilt here ok so when you make a transaction ok sending style talk about chaincode also so that we will discuss both then only I will get a clear idea next just change code
chaincode is what you write into smart contract write write some you write something in a smart contract so here it is called as chaincode ok so when you write a chain code what happens it gets distributed throughout the network same as a switch smart contract when you write a smart contract what happens it gets distributed everybody right so here also chain code is distributed everybody ok fine now what will happen is in
daily order I will create this Genesis block ok and he do it will mention like who all through membership services he will mention like who all can send what all Trans men who are all authorised to use this network so this is all will be mentioned in the Genesis file ok Genesis file and then what will happen is
he is ok I have a USA Peer ok so before that you remember using this membership services he knows that who all has got what all certificate ok who all has issued so all those he will added to the Genesis file ok and recognise who are the PS and then he will add this to a Genesis file and then he would create something called channel so there is a channel showing this channel everybody can communicate
so this channel for example it is called manufacturing channel manufacturing distribution channel UK likewise channel is created it might be confusing let me once again rephrase repeat ok so over we are going to look at BMW network ok how it is
just give me sec ok so in in a compare with ethereum blockchain everything is a note ok there is no single point of failure you have different notes here the architecture demands so if you have at least some reminders looked at big data and always what is architecture that it is a master slave architecture so similarly hear the architectural you have a n t
we called order you have something called here and you have before that you had membership services in Peer again there are couple of you know there is a difference there is endorsing peer there is a comet appear ok this is how logically or not logic in both logical and physical in this route is arranged and when you make a transaction and so this what is arranged ok so in this case what happens
BMW is owner of the network he sets of this order ok so order me know he is in Germany and he is setting up this Genesis file it takes like he mentions like who all has to be part of the network it is mentioned in the Genesis file and then the network is spend up ok so while spinning of the network Genesis file and member services alone is not sufficient on top of that you will have to
and create a channel so that is where the channel is Genesis has both membership services + this channel ok both will be created so in this membership services we can say that ok USA pear have only rolls of performing what we call only one
we can send break transactions or something related to break chaincode he can do one can set up the rule here so the rules will be defined here and now it comes to change code what is chain code is nothing but the smart contract whatever rules have set up right so that rules are the code is getting deployed so this is how the blockchain is found in the hyperledger world typology fabric world this is how it is formed so
again you when you look at the stadium we have seen like level db so here also they use something called level DB or they use kochtv both another level 1 can use level DB or couch TB both can be used here and in aquarium world it is called state variable OK when u store something in the level DBS call state variable here it is called
old state game on both of it similar only world state ok and when you when you create a blockchain I really it's all blocks write blogs and put two and transaction so here also its blocks transactions ok and the consensus algorithm so now let me finish the blocks and source suppose this USA presenting some transaction what will happen is so those all will be formed
Lok ok so everyone have the copy of that block ok so that lol gets Road solve fine ok same same concept and everyone will have this level in TB everything is same instead of their you see something to change data here it would be a different place but it's all one and the same ok search called World state it gets a distributed the same cons
but what happens when you send the transaction in ethereum there is something called proof of work right you execute proof of work and make sure the transaction is right ok whether the transaction legit legit is valid using ID proof of work in ethereum ethereum you you something called proof of work but in hyperledger when you send a transaction again it is plug and play what all you can
you can if you want to use raft algorithm you are good to go I think if you want to use proof of stake you can I don't know whether proof of stake is there so if you want to use PB ft bebe ft new number this is the default one ok remember pbf TV look that this army general story ok so if you want we can use PB ft here ok so like why is a different algorithms can be but only one algorithm
enter network it cannot be like a multiple draught and PB ft that doesn't work that way okay is a rough copy BFT so BMW states that I want to go with BBA 57 have to follow ppsp but you have suppose BMW want to set up another network with that it is ok ok that is fine this the basic consensus algorithm and distribution channel why this distribution channel is important because one cancer
different channels suppose if you want to set up manufacturing channel and if you want to set up something called as sales channel ok this is the privacy you get in fabric ok suppose if you said something called sales channel ok and you make UK and India appear in sales channel ok and manufacturing channel only USA in this case what happens USA
cannot or will not receive any data pertaining to sales channel sales related information so that way it is bifurcated ok so I think there's a lot of terminologies Let me take up some questions and once again I am going to explain the same concept and then will that should be it for today
ok so I got lot of questions okay so I can Unmute probly not that is the best way we could have a conversation so others right so Anand Jason you know let me know if you want to Unmute if you didn't understand the concept let me know I can answer ok yeah I will do that so probly I'll go Sudheer first
yeah go ahead Surya so my question is you said everyone will have a copy of the block and yes you also specified that there is a manufacturing and sales channel so sorry got some confusion also if everyone has a copy of the data block now I'll always blocks different then like some will have only manufacturing and some will have only Sales Information exactly you are right
Bandra identical so what will happen is manufacturing this one is a us a ride so he gets only blocks which are pertaining to USA winner manufacturing so only he get that blocks so if u sales channel only get sales blocks ok ok make sense
thank you then let me go Shailendra had some questions write a good challenge
they can be either Indore sir or committed ok
Suddi decide all thank you thank you some questions you have to Unmute yourself think yes host My book show the channel is like a sub blockchain within a blockchain
exact location 12 instead of calling it is a sub blockchain what I would call it as a separate blocking separate block a manufacturing is a separate blockchain and another thing what is the one sales is a separate blockchain and not only that depending upon the jio location manufacturing us might have a different manufacturing India might have different project
it could be like I know if your dinner if your business needs that you'll have to have a different channel in terms of privacy you can create different channels one thing I am not able to understand is my order is entered the actually creating a bottleneck within the whole blockchain like now as you said by transaction load means you need more orders it's like it still master-slave kind of not know as compared to everybody because
yeah I'll send some infomania against this approach ok so that order the single point of failure not so if there is only one order it cinnabon to say that is a problem in existing problem but that is how the architecture is what happens is when you send a transaction so now we are not there it so when you send a transaction how the transaction is valley is getting validate I will tell you the next class ok so order does a lot of work
what is the meaning of being at the store order the word means that it create a new order of the main maintain the order of the transaction verification is also what order does what is vndb something it is distribution so verification and distribution to the PS editing and there's only pushing transaction pending transactions not know who is creating the
Lok audios I don't even recruiting blogger PS also create in blocks that is Pierce will propose a block ok period can say that you are these are my transaction and can propose a block but ultimately it will be validated by the order and distributed so what day what is happening is here is also can do some validation so like they also do the validation but the final says from order
approve so that becomes a headache right now thank you so that one right it will take another 1520 minutes so I don't want to get into that how this transaction simulation works we look at the next class so anybody else want to discuss
suggestion do you want me to Unmute you can have a conversation ok
Hello Jason hello you can go I can hear you I can hear you not able to hear me
cannot hear me ok fine it's ok not a problem I can explain to the question is in this use case that your shut the order and pay responsibility when the parts are supplied will the Pier perform the role of committed what what happens is suppose latest take this example in this case we have given us a person
some validity in some authority so here you can make him both end user and computer ok he can both Indoor and comment or he can just pick a mendoza OK it is depending upon the network like you know who has what permissions and privileges accordingly you can provide that reception role based restrictions
what is this Justin did you get it so so can't let me quickly and meet you got the phone can you have some questions right
Satya hello hello sorry I am not able to hear you maybe you are a new person
so for some reason not able to hear ok ok fine here let me know if you have any questions ok so any other questions Sudhanshu Rakesh Anand
Subhash ok ok fine yeah so did I did you get my answer Jason
Sadar Bazar question from Shailendra do we have any backup for order yeah you can create 100 this advice to create one or many address so I can repeat this use case you have shut the order and pay responsibility when the parts are supplied will the Peer performs the role of computer
if you have both access right does both an ender dosa and computer responsibility roll okay if you have assigned a role in such a way that it has both and orcerin comforter he can do both ok so find time I don't see any questions probly will
next week to leave your you no comments no feedback looks like you know there was no feedback yesterday and that's what I came to know so let me know if you have any feedback please leave it good or bad anything is not a problem ok
will we be simulating this exercise yes will be simulating so team if you have time right what you do as you know there is some instructions we can follow like you know if you can practice one will do it in a class but still if you could do it on around right once he'll be easier all the stuff after
so from here try to innovate solve PC copy paste of you know I will you just try and make sure that things are working so well we do I'll explain like why we are doing it ok ok team thank you all have a good weekend see you all next week
