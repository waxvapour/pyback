hey good morning friends are you able to hear me is my voice loud and clear and also let me know if you could see my screen
ok good thank you thank you free so we have 8 participants let's give another
5 minute show list good morning for will get started in another 5 minutes in a before that if you have any questions let me know so Vilas I saw you know your question in WhatsApp
suit idea is right so currently if you look at the current payment system it is hanging lot of transactions per second where is bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in its way less compared to what we do with Bitcoin ok but yes they are working on a plan their you know it Aryan is planning to release something like 1 million transactions per second okay so these are all living in a development stage not released into market rate
eventually over a period of time you will be sitting in a weird be seeing like a faster transactions in a JSON is mentioning that my voice is getting muted or how about others are you feeling the same
ok Jason looks like another able to hear me clearly can you in your check your system or something that ok fine
symptoms of time frame we can expect it earlier we can expect in and within next 1 year maybe we can look at something like in a fast as lightning network even litecoin is working on something called lightning network
it is given that 2 more minutes and then let's get started
a good phone looks like the question do we copy paste all question into a word doc so I don't know that I don't know about that
an input oranges just hold on for Unity today probably I will check with the support team or know the better option would be to raise a ticket ticket to support all this assessment and the project work is certificate by different team ok ok thank you another
movement started after that
let's get started so until last class what we have seen is basically we
first enough we discuss about the trading or the current banking system what is the problem with that what is the concept of decentralized a distributed system how it is making a Paradigm shift then we looked at Bitcoin so that was the first distributed my number blocks in system so we look that that for a while and develop that some of them what is happening behind the scenes in terms of Bitcoin what is the transaction what is
basic basic stuff what is the wallet and we look that how to initiate a transaction what happens in terms of consensus algorithm proof of work and the and we were starting up with blockchain you know what is blockchain where we can use this what a smart contracts ok so high level we are just getting started and in this module what we solve what is the major difference between
traditional database and a blockchain system that is why we ended and today what we are going to see his first first of all parents is difference between a blockchain and a distributed ledger OK when you when you come across in your office environment or when you discuss with someone instead of blockchain you could see People talking or mentioning that are distributed ledger ok so what is that
distributed ledger all about ok we look at that Sandeep let me explain few of these concepts and then let's get back to that no one is distributed ledger or sometime she will called sblt and distributed ledger so nice just blockchain ok so the ideas if you look at block
chain so take take Bitcoin as an example ok so what we do Bitcoin or ethereum as an example what we do is there are transactions so these transactions are grouped together inside a block and this blog gets verified by some consensus Ul Qadri have seen is proof of work and then its saying ok ideas that transactions which are inside the block is immutable or it's not possible to Tampa
ok so that is my core concept ok framing into a block is what Bitcoin thought about that sophitorium box but if you look at the real world ok if you forget all about this blog grouping them into a transactions OK what we need is basically if transaction is initiated it shouldn't be tampered ok it should be there forever forever if tomorrow I have some reason to go look up what happened with the transaction
I should be able to ok so that is core concept of it ok so when after looking at Bitcoin and ethereum if you look at the enterprise ok so blockchain can be used to the enterprise borders with an office and not this is what it is why should I run a proof of work algorithm which takes so many 10 minutes competition power why should I do that and I am going to work suppose if you take IBM for an example
inside IBM office they want to implement some kind of a blockchain so what do you want to introduce prefer for all this in a mining Rig in which makes innominds and create cryptocurrency is why to have something called cryptocurrency is nothing like that all they want is a full proof system so if you make a transaction you should be visible like what has happened what has happened about ok and it should not be easily tampered with so that's the whole idea
IBM and other company start like you know we should create something like a distributed ledger ok let's not called does blockchain with called as a distributed ledger blt you what it's basically is same thing whatever happens in blockchain you initiate transaction that gets verified ok someone other network would verify that in of this transaction has been initiated by this person and it will be stored in Ledger history ok like a just imagine that it is like it's going to be stored
table format ok so everyone have this ledger of transactions instead of having it doesn't block ok so that's the idea of a distributed ledger ok there are no - ok no concept on ocean of cryptocurrency maintaining the integrity using transactions so that's the idea of it high level did you get it guys any questions
ok so question from Sandeep that's related to mining Sri is that private blockchain that's right its private blockchain that's right Re Sandeep if my pics transactions in a blocked then how long is validation if minor pics transactions in a blocked then how launch validation will happen someone will pick transaction ABC someone will pick 20
yeah that's right Sandeep what will happen is each one will have a different knots to find ok so minor any not find the main office now its ok it could be totally different ok but the idea is the norms there finding the number they are finding it should once you do that proof of work algorithm in should get so many number of zeros which is demanded by the network I can do whatever is the difficulty factor that many number of
heroes you'll have to find YouTube your transactions you are open to do that answer your question ok so we have seen this should call distributed ledger technology or Technology ok
Sobha fund money like to have given comparison high level comparison between distributed ledger and blockchain if you look at blockchain it is chronological order it A Block 1 then follows Block 2 Block 1 hash is linked with Block 2 size so that's why it is all linked in in blockchain ok here it is it is more of a fat
transaction is initiated it should be open to all and it should not be tampered with so that's the idea of old distributed ledger you see sequence of blocks there is no change message so required consensus algorithm actually this is wrong OK Here they mentioned consensus algorithm is not required ask them to correct it so consensus algorithm is required but it is not required like you know you should have something like a proof of work ok
because we're consensus algorithm is it is a distributed right so if there is no consensus algorithm anybody can make a transaction ok so that should be an agreement that whether yes this transaction is right or wrong there is consensus syllabus but not proof of work blockchain not so easily scalable so if you look at why theyre talking about in terms of scalable blockchain if you bring in proof of work ok and other thing
employee can change in the enterprise world it is getting difficult ok to manage the transaction will have to think about hard for her enterprise you know there there are you for example if you look at you know that may be faulty transaction something could happen so those all it's very difficult to handle in terms of blockchain ok but not in town and not with distributed ledger
show that a couple of questions it is an either or technology that is you can use blockchain or dlt you can't combine both technology that shit oh what is happening is a blockchain is actually it's a technology so people develop platforms out of it one platform is called what
ethereum platform you are open to choose and distributed ledger suppose if you want to choose something that is Equaliser and you don't care about cryptocurrency is an other stuff then you can choose something like a multiple ledger fabric ok so that is another platform which focus on the distributed ledger ok so depending upon your use case so what is that I am going to develop ok and what is Samay in Gold what is the purpose I am trying to solve based on that you have to choose the
under the question for like you can't combine both the Technologies no it's totally like you know two different platforms we can't do partial something like you know your OS runs on Microsoft and alien experience about the different you can run 50/50 ok so question from Dharani done without mining how transaction Cinderella validated we will look at that in today's class will look at that
how do you decide which and when to apply blockchain rdl Tina transactions so example suppose if you suppose if you want to go into a banking world ok so what happens is banks to do settlements between banks suppose you initiate a transaction from one bank to another bank ok so we are transferring from Bank of America to Chase Bank ok some transactions happens ok
and are those transactions you want to make it in terms of distributed ledger in what the time is it good for them instead of going into a blockchain more so it is purely based on use case once you go through a lot of use case then you will be able to point out like know what I would be needing for example if you look at supply chain inter supply chain industry they want to track a lot of goods a lot of work good
like in or counterfeit products I want to track that case distributed ledger becomes a good technology question from Sudhir if in dlt if there is no chain isn't there other stuff data tampering earlier Plot No 9 Sudhir even if it's going to be a transaction in distributed ledger transaction based still it can't be tampered with solar system has that intelligence only thing it is it is
not framed as a block next these are some of the popular day by day this changing actually ok so I'm still in ethereum majority of people use eatery I'm so if you look at it area in it is cryptocurrency based ok
so if you want to do some transaction you should have it works both in public and private chain if in our class what we are going to Look At Us will take them and we will use a private chain set up that is for internal if you want to use in office premises or your customer use case something like that you'll be used inside office network for enterprise we can use it and also you are good to go with the public and also has some incentives and other things ok
this pretty much we've seen it all ok we have proof of work ok so let your level insurance call block level Chowk A block level ok and smart contract code and we have something called currencies ok and if you look at hyperledger fabric ok so hyperledger fabric is nothing but so what happened is they want to create something like a distributed ledger Technology for the enterprise and they have created this
open source community where people can come and contribute ok so IBM is one of the major contributor to this project hyperledger fabric project so almost 70% they contribute and others also partnering with it and this boy and the next one is at recorder ok so R3 corda what the tortoise like in this Is Kadar platform name is called
is banks and Financial Institutions thought that will have to come up with a platform on our own ok cause its all finance related and they have regulatory laws regulatory stuff so they wanted to create a platform for themselves a group of banks almost like I think 40 + banks I don't know how much is the number right now so they are all from the community and then started developing called as platform ok so this will surely good for financial related stuff
differential relay transaction so there coming up to the platform in terms of consensus what consensus algorithm we are going to use in fabric will see in this class ok and if you look at the fabric how you can write a smart contract code you can write in languages using go and even in recent times in in in our class also we are going to see where we will use JavaScript to create
smart contract code ok and even there are tools which can create a plug and play Smart contract ok Uni not even write the code to some extent you can do that find any questions
show the main advantage of a distributed ledger you see as the name States it's a distributed ledger everyone can take a look at it what it is ok and faster transaction reason being so if you look at in the Bitcoin world what happens is once you make a transaction ok that all group all this transaction group in block and then it ghost for mining and that takes 10 minutes and other party has to verify it has to wait for 6
fication so probably if you send a transaction normal in Bitcoin world it's going to take half an hour ok 30 minutes so if look at it in the enterprise use case suppose they wanted to take between in a supply chain transaction some kind of business transaction ok for each transaction if you are going to wait 30 minutes it's not solving the problem at all so enterprise we need fast things should be faster so that case distributed ledger
better fit Jason or this the only platforms while showing us like that turns off lights on there a lot of platforms to the popular ones are eaten there is something called fabric that is something called multichain there is cold there is quorum there are a lot of platforms ok
now if you look at Mehdi Healthcare Industry that thought like you know we need to create our own platform in there creating something call middle age so there are a lot of platforms coming up we don't know like you know what is going to survive for now it idiom and Fabric looks good uh why koda doesn't have any currency in oh that's the way it is no that's over there designers they don't want to bring any
concept of currencies so Vamsi Krishna like and I'm still a bit confused about it OK I will I'll give some examples advantage of blockchain these are advantages of blocks in blockchain on can easily since it is distributed for auditors another it is easy to
unitrack liquid has gone in the past your transactions call ok now I will give quick example like you know why blockchain I'm legit example let's take your supply chain industry ok blockchain I think we have enough examples let me quickly explain like you what is going to happen with the supply chain industry supply chain let's look at BMW car manufacturing so BMW
who manufactures cars ok now what we need is BMW doesn't produce all the parts ok he outsourcers different parts to different person supposed break his brakes are manufactured by company or minute to companies to companies are you creating are producing breaks ok
Republic or Roadster ok but two companies which take me not to companies and then they are assembling it to make a BMW in this case what is happening is so awesome that each one company a company we all are connected to a distributed ledger not a blockchain or 1st will say blockchain it say that they are all connected to blockchain now this a company what they want to enter as I produce
okay Break serial number 001 again this number ok and it is making a transaction the that reproduce Break serial number 001 and he enters the transaction that goes into a blockchain everybody in the network knows that when the real has produced a break which has serial number 001 ok so this became set transaction ok so similarly
be like whatever transactions show in blockchain world what will happen is blocked so group of transactions like 123 like in a lot of transactions will be grouped together inside a block and then it'll go for something called proof of work ok then it will be in this proof of work 10 minutes and for confirmation on
20 minutes ok and all this has - CPU power extra ok so all these has to be done in terms of a blockchain solution what if you look at in the distributed ledger what they are saying use if he makes a transaction fine I create one common database ok so this is a common database between all the party
so this is transaction will be in the ledger ok this everybody can see next 20 transaction and it goes on Ok same benefit you get here okay the technology take cares that it is it cannot be tampered with ok so A and B cannot go and delete the transactions ok or modify the transactions and anybody can see their transactions in this case and beauty of a test this translation
transaction goes immediately OK so there is no waiting time of 20 minutes or 30 minutes and there is no CPU CPU intensive any algorithms hope you got it 20 so that's the idea of it ok question from Gayatri what is the risk of having the consensus at transaction this is ledger level there is no risk asses OK it is cheaper it depends upon the
see even you know let me block or transactions what consensus is nothing but your framing a rules that a distributor rules that whether this transaction is right or wrong similarly image with proof of work also I am in so nothing about risk it's about the business use case and I'm where the technology really fits in for you ok if you look at in this case we cannot wait for 30 + minutes
so that's the reason dlt is a good fit question from dinner is Dennis Alaika without - how it won't be tampered ok there are - there are consensus I'll come in as I mentioned I know there is consensus algorithm so my name is typically why they got this name - is because I like last week I mentioned right so they
in order to Digha gold you need to mine that over and then get cold ok symbol if you look at in a blockchain world they are doing some work to get that Bitcoins are either OK Here you know they are not called minors in fabric world their called as validators ok so they have a different name but still in on the Deck confirm whether that transaction which is released is
no its full proof or exit right or wrong transaction limit transaction like any risk if not needed for reality there is no risk there is no risk in fact it is a benefit in enterprise vault is benefit for the consumer who will validate the transaction
dlt so he knows all we will look at into it ok so now we have just started with blt if you look at our 7th class we will look at only hyperledger fabric ok so at the time you will get to know for now I think and I just get to know that you know this is the major difference between dlt and blockchain okay validators are not paid in reality show
no more if I think more questions are based on you know who is maintaining the integrity of Fidelity ok how how it is done ok just hold on for me for a while ok so for next half an hour we will touch base some concerns algorithm and at the end of the mean on the 7th class we will be there more into it till then just give me some time he hai Rupesh
ok this is Rupesh has joined this and this is first class okay Rupesh ok fine you know there are recordings ok so you know right after this class tried to you know go through the host 2 audio sessions completely ok so that you up to speed you have already lesson
I'm showing in terms of installing virtualbox you know it is in you will have to touch you not touch base with the supporting so any installation for assignments or project related work in there is a surprise
dedicated team they work actually 24/7 and they help out 13 we have a duracast support number ok think it's here give me a minute let me say I will find out and let you know
support number ok fine so now we are going to select the type of fertilizer at blocks in system and you will find out in like what is suited for our environment ok first one how many copies of ledger ok that is suppose that you are going to maintain account for yourself that is let's say that you are going to
in your home account okay in that case you don't require blockchain at all there is no multipart in that case one then you know you can have like a person bank account by your own home account cannot share with anybody ok find location I'll add it so prob what I will do is Rupesh I will be sharing your WhatsApp link ok so once you click on that you will be able to OK so the next IAS who can use these copies
ok so when when there is many who can use this when there is a ledger and if you say that certain people only have to have access to particular ledger then it becomes a permission ditching ok so that's what we have looked that in the code and all that is I suppose something like a financial related group right they want to access the only have to have access to the data then it becomes permissioned
ok and I'm so this army and who can use these copies anybody can use OK then again there is a question ok Anybody Can anybody participate like you never even can public can participate in that case it becomes of blockchain if there is become you know if it is permission but people still can join with the help of some you know you suppose they give an example of ripple that is
some company says that you know you'll have to provide us se tomorrow government is creating a blockchain and they want to want you to participate in that ok so you cannot directly plug and play and then participate so probly they can ask your social security number or no in India they could I ask you Aadhar card so based on that you are joining the network ok so this permission public ledger the whole blockchain
so depending on your use case suppose NASA mention some government related so of course like you not anybody anybody in the world can participate in the blockchain there should be some validation mechanism so that's about it so now we will look at
no we are going to look at the header structure of Bitcoin so till now any questions or be good next year going to move to a different topic so so what we are going to look at now is
so last week we look at proof of work right so now we will take a block and see like you know what all constitutes A block so high level what we saw that is last week ok there is a block and there are so many transaction inside that can there is a head there is an Ounce by now you know why you are you should be all this should be knowing like what is inside now we are going to 12 more and find out like what is this merkle root
look at that ok so this is a structure of a block ok so these all details will be there in a blocked so what is it version number nouns the answer what you are trying to find and in a previous
block hash that is how you are going to rain on this is required for a header then timestamp then there is something called market route then there is transaction list these are all there now let us go into in real time and find out like find out the header so blockchain that info opening blocked
ok here as such Mein Dev not mentioned as header ok for that let's open Bitcoin paper what is height height is nothing but people call it has blocked height 0123 and we are in the
500 5002 block block so that is height
so this is the blog header basically in case of innovation previous block heater hash ok so we will deep dive into merkle root has what is this merkle root hash then you know time what is the timestamp ok so this is 10 bit system with the difficulty what is the difficulty level
difficulty factor and then on what is the real answer what iPhone if you look at let's take the real block so all those are there ok so one is in you can look at the difficulty bed she can look at the launch in a look at the Mughal route previous hash and look at the version and there is one more nonsense all of it so you are looking at all
Cut like a notice that spider block Sudhir all institutes block so block has a two portion it has two portions so right now it'll have a header and and also followed by all this Transaction ID list so we look at that also so if you look at here so we are
looking at this blog and this blog as a header information and it has all the transaction details like you know who has sent to what to solve these details are in here ok so very beautiful thing is this merkle root a look at merkle root now
Anand the clients in ABB started at 7:30 and when I mentioned last week right that will be starting soon so the first half an hour what we have seen as you know the difference between distributed ledger and blockchain ok and now we are just starting with Bitcoin structure OK what is the head of structure
we the people are right probly you can take listen to the audio conversation is ok fine so now to this other transaction just ok we will quickly looked at like how it is
these are the structure ok so I don't want to give a good deep dive into this lucky know how how how many by Chitra Sen all the stuff ok so it's enough ok Jannu all those parameters BSc now we'll see like you know how this merkle root gets generated ok so someone ask me about Block height ok so block height is nothing but the another 02 block it is change the rate block after block it
Sadik hadzovic keypad is blocked as a number so that particular number block number denotes the height of the blockchain where we are today question I didn't get location why is the size important in that what size you mentioned you mentioning about this one
so you suppose if you're ok this is a protocol size and also that is how we know a header so that's all they are mentioned again if it is ahead of that so it has to be something like our TCP IP Protocol protocol write this is it is friend
that's right position so blockaded is always it bites the three cities parameters right only the transactions can change but these are fixed ok so that you know this is Defined by protocol in when you say version version can have only maximum 4 bytes not more than that is blocked head similar to length exactly
that's right ok so now primary so what all will see like a block theatre has so basically so if you look at the block kal so you can all this so blockchain dot info so if you look at it is mentioned as height it's nothing but 573 is a block number 87 400
Crocin you can you can either she doesn't enter invite people in Bitcoin world it's so it is called ok height of the block and next thing is blog header hash ok so every block is denoted by a hash number ok if you look at this is the number 51376 but this is for our defence League where it is a blocked number but this blog
hash hash ok so if you look at this this is a hash of it ok so this denotes that this is the block and if it its all linked each block is linked with the previous block's if you click previous blocked it will take you to the 513876 now you have your own 518375 we look at the previous block it will be 51387 400 goes on Ok
make sense okay so the block hash identify the block uniquely so it means that you know know it will not have a different number so otherwise each blocks will have a unique number ok it's not going to be different from one block to another block
the next one is so block hash is not included in inside blocks data structure so that cannot be right so what happens is this has will be outside so if you look at previous block we can look at the header information ok they said you see you have only the previous block Yashoda you will not have the current block heater
it is the public key of the block where do you mean Anand is it the block public key value see it so public key private key is only for the transaction not at the block level no it is not the hash public key it is you know you find out all the
Aadhar details and then it is hatched that's ok phone ok so where is the highest road in the blog so once you have this details redheaded details once you do a double hash of it then you get the block head office as simple as that you are getting it it is stored in a lonely the previous blocks is getting stored ok fine
unblock hai typing you got an idea like you know what is the block height ok so next we will get into merkle root ok so that's very important cell explain in a list then I am also going to try the same thing so I'll just use the notes won't be apart ok so basically the idea is
lipstick Shailendra Mallika Jiska Peninsula making a transaction OK what transaction so that is that you are transferring some Bitcoin to someone else some kind of transaction Bitcoin transaction me so all this L1 L2 L3 l4 is nothing but the transaction ok so what happens is moment you send a transaction ok so this transaction these two transactions are taken in a first this
transaction has which has it is highest ok so that is nothing but has of L1 alone is nothing but a transaction ok so this transaction hash this all of this transaction are hatched ok after hatching now you get to hear this right now these two has a certikin and it is hatched again similarly these two has a certain and has talking OK then these two houses are taken and has taken so it is like a no typical I think binary tree
it so that's a binary tree there will be two roots to leaves and you know it goes down and then finally you end up in a parent so this is the top has so that so it is designed so why we are designing I'll tell you but I never did you get it
ok fine so let's play in like any problem take so if you look at the internal Data Structure how this mobile root works it is all hash-based ok so what they do is so let's take Alice Steak Alice Bob Charlie
get the new so they are making and transactions ok each transaction lips called that Bitcoin transfer get some Bitcoin transactions ok so our ideas so this is a transaction this is the transaction ok so this transaction ok first first little letters in this this becomes a transaction and this becomes hash of
so let me not do this again it's the same ok so we are always first hashing the transaction why we are doing it I will tell you so that will be clear ok we're taking the hash of it has of it ok this transaction hash hash hash and Hast OK so the know the idea is right so it is always here all these transactions ok and remember your headache and hold only certain number of see your Hyder Hyder Mughal route
has only 32 bytes right you cannot have all the transactions correct but you are blocked ok there is two portion of it one is header so the other person is in the remaining transactions these both constitutes A block correct I see some questions coming up in a just hold on for a sec
finish this topic and then answer so when you look at blog you know two things constitut A Block 1 is header of it and remaining the transactions part of it ok so in the header there is something called Mukul route so this merkle root is derived from the underlying transactions ok so whatever in this example what you have seen this T1 T2 T3 T4 ok
so this this will contain T1 T2 T3 and T4 ok so these transactions will be there and it has header also has a Mercury component ok now what they are doing his work route by default how it works is if some transaction comes so this transaction would be hatched ok so has of it and these two will be hashedin these two will be hatched
and finally there for Mahesh ok that is called merkle root has why it is required ok let's say that this route hashes some 0x 123 some hit something like that ok so the ideas so you are making a transaction T3 T4 ok even if you change the smallest bit here from zero to one even if there is a smallest change here the entire route
when to change Ok with the route has whatever is derived from all this Asus right so this will change completely even it is changed here ok so why so there in home why we are validating because if you look at if you look at once the transaction is validation it is it is propagated to the network OK so the network what it looks at is easily they can be raised in this market route and find out whether
BF cheated or not if there is a faulty transaction here ok so this transaction through it will be completely different on what you are broadcasted to network ok doesn't make sense ok thank you so if there are question from dinner so if there are 100 transaction they will parrot all up
this will take 10 minutes now so that will not take 10 minutes so the spelling of this all taken this in a fraction of seconds or may be lesser than that the time takes the 10 minutes time it's taken only for finding the right nonce number ok you are trying to find out the number which has that money difficulty number of zeros so that is what takes 10 minutes question from Mallika is it too I didn't
and if I change the transaction level that's right to catch someone has changed some transaction level someone has this mine has added some transaction that will be easily caught question from Thani how do they hatch transaction address or which data of transaction is hatched so the entire transaction is Ashton so how do they hatch transaction so there are all
ok so I know if you are from Java background or something if you look at Java even I don't about.net if you look at all your objects by default your objects are hatched right so something like that they have some algorithm 6 to 56 using that you even you can download this algorithm like you know there is a small tool I can show you how to
sexy some ABC something like that ok Sweet give you get hash ok and if you see ABCD it we're totally different has ok so this uses some algorithm awesome method in a basically few programatically few this is a method so we'll have to include that library and then decide that it's Hast
nexans so other questions were basically to establish traceability kind of that's right for every blocked in and that's how it is formed found out so will there always be even pair of transactions good question Jason your next level later let me know I'll say that will be know how many transaction from the merkle root
how many transaction good question I don't think so but I don't have the right answer right now from Michael route I'll try to find out tennis question from earlier when the minor validates will we consider this as well yeah yeah he will consider this as well that's right
so how do you know if a particular ID is hacked or not by looking at it when I basically I get ID from you in MCI is what I will do I will get it the only from you then I looked at the hash ok so basically if you look at the minor what he does his will get the block from you in a proposal
someone who won will propose you get the header details okay from the header details you'll find ok did you really find out the difficulty number if so that should be number of zeros then he will go look at the transaction level then find out wanted to make sensor details will be there and merkle root yeah you can see what happens is your clubbing all the trance
suppose you have 20000 transactions or 7000 transactions so it is very difficult to store all those thousand transactions inside header right so but if you can have has and me Store at a single number in The Monk fruit in it so easy so what happened supposed tomorrow if someone wants to pamper the block ok and add a fraudulent transaction is the interim accrued will change make sense so all other since it's a day
good network others will not agree or block your work to do this like a hash of a hash of hash that's right you are right ok so now its ok so Michael rood in terms of head your right this is memory displays it is fast to maintain
Nisa basics of bro provides meaning integrity of the transactions over all the transaction you have a single route so if someone wants to edit the block and change something it will not be allowed so it is easy way of maintaining integrity so question is sha 256 of transaction here transaction 1 what
is what a number or address or amount no it isn't it is not any one of these OK when you initiate a transaction will look at in the 3rd class when you initiate transaction what happens is lot of details goes with that it's not the amount or is not the address it is like whom you are sending to what is the amount your sending ok and those details is going as part of transistor that hold together is known as transaction
make sense taruni then how it is hatched Theni how has this in a basically sha 256 ok so if you let me show me
I think people like there is some question about what a transaction so we look at the 3rd class but now I really give a glimpse of it so if you look at this transaction let's take this transaction so this is not an amount ok it's not an amount of public key so far this transaction ok so there are some details
when this transaction was initiated from home to home what was the ETA which was sent ok how much transaction cost was involved altogether confuse a transaction make sense so these details are taken this this is has you see a number I write you take this details and these details are hatched and then you get this number this is nothing but the transaction hash did you get it
Dharani dedicated Dharani so this question from getting so what happens we have a even number of trance
Samsung the odd number of transactions even number of transactions fine ok so we cannot see like this thing even number of and sessions called strictly binary tree write something in that this would you know transaction is hasbi is has the Navy is highest then both of us as ok so if there is odd number of transaction ok so if you look at here there is only
7 transactions starts from 007 transaction so what happened there is no transaction then in this case what will happen if they take this transaction and I did hear in the tree so that's how it is done make sense
yeah transaction is duplicated in case of odd number of transactions ok guys let's take a quick 5 minutes break ok for some reason I am getting call from edureka I dunno if some folks are not able to join or something let me check with them in the meantime let's not take five minute break ok sir ok
guys I'm back
oh I didn't get it question Anand what is mind block mind only need ok mind is nothing but another block which is in a has validated gone through validations and it's all done and then it is in part of block in that is mind block
ok so much you just look at how old is illustrated this disconnected 16 17 18 in all this is height basically another previous size is always connected so this is nothing but this merkle root and have shown you like and how its all connected
no question from JSON previous has refers to previous blocks market route no it is only referring to the this entire block the next one is so till now in a components of we look at the required to implement a blockchain ok ok so when
can we look at blockchain ok so what is that required for blockchain suppose you don't have any three more something ok you don't suppose you want to create a brand new platform what is that what is that is to have in mind OK so one is so the underlying that should be a machine which communicates peer-to-peer that should be a communication this peer-to-peer Communications nothing but a virtual machine
this virtual machine concept isn't area based OK so the next one is consensus algorithm so since it is a distributed ledger I did she shared ledger it has to be agreed by multiple parties so that should be consensus algorithm have put a node application is nothing but so everyone everyone can participate in the network right so they they should have some interface to interact with the blockchain that is nothing
node application so once you can think of all of the you can we know your good to create a platform so we know this one day explain in depth like and what is it all about any questions or do we have to create a
network abhi in our class 9 practical session will be creating our own network will create our own Shailendra so properties required gain a notice
question from Dennis shared ledger component is where we determine if we will use private or public blockchain model ok very good question so here question from Genesis where do you think it is a pleasure ok so here it is here here is where we'll decide consensus algorithm right if you look at Bitcoin world it is proof of work and some
this is why we decide to properties required menu if you want to create your own blockchain so but basically in that's not be double spending what is double spending used in a same transaction should not be duplicated ok and the first class what I've said like in it should be disturbed you still fungible so they can both money aspect into it
ok so this is more about Bitcoin ok so I don't agree with this all parameters ok so now will look at how a blockchain can be implemented in stock market ok look at one example
total how many questions are we good to go at the stock market example so if you look at stock market ok so what happens in India
we have something called SEBI ok security exchange Board of India likewise there is a name for us I don't remember exactly so there is some entity so the regulatory a entity then let's come from a consumer level so consumer user Okay user needs and interface to interact with ok so that is supposed let's say that he uses ICICI s
the medium of buying stocks and stuff like that ok Robin us user uses something called Merrill Lynch ok so that is so you buy stocks shares and that ok then security exchange board or some so let's take company Google ok so Google wants to list there they want to go public and they want to release the
stocks into the mirror for public to pick your then what happens is first Central Central Board of security exchange board what do you do if they will look at the company and they will look at all the details and they will decide ok whether this can be listed in the exchange or not once it is decided yes it can be listed ok after that after following they announce it gets listed OK then then what happens is good
state and their be some rights suppose let's say that Google has like 1 or 2000 said you can just give me a some random number ok and 500 shares are thousands years allocated to public okay anybody can buy this ok now what happens if everyone uses some kind of a medium right so that is ICICI Merrill Lynch people can use a different medium to buy ok
so what you happen in here is there will be mediums where you can there there call registers and there are different entities they are all middle man so there will be a middleman OK so were suppose ICICI could be they can participate in the middleman procedure also supposed to say that there is ICICI ok and another user you say something like Share Khan
ok for the trading ok he also uses ICICI so what will happen is this MM Public shares right so which is to be traded ok it has to be open to public so if you look at this doesn't even if it comes from ICICI as user interface he should be able to see share can also should be able to see this house and UK its
call me like you know if I come from Sharekhan I can buy thousand and I can buy 901 ICICI only hundred it's not that way ok so where where the hell is happening is nothing but they all have built-in Complex systems where they do real time settlement in summer real time in summer ok they find out like ok how much is the amount of shares are there in the market so ke this are the intermediate trees who hold this
Sunday Universal it provides to public so that is so and probly HDFC is another thing HDFC ok something like that he doesn't know that he goes through able to know if you look at here no one has to maintain lot number of Lord
data Okay in terms like how many shares how many companies are there their bowl in all of these entities has to be synced up ok and bank has to take care the mountain number of funds ok and he should not cheat that this instead of ICICI supposing is releasing a new in releasing a new share without security exchange board like let's say that Doodle
that is trying to release Asha 200 should not happen you came under train know how this all things are done is it is all done through lot of really train also there are a lot of security audits regulatory norms ok Prema Associates lot of things are done and that is out this integrity is total integrity is maintained ok to maintain this integrity of you know all this settlements in this full proof auditing all
people spend millions of dollars to make sure that no one breaks the system ok previously close all paper based now I run to in a digital world and digital and system but still I know there are lot of dollars which are spent on this middlemen ok go take care of all this so now we are going to look at like you know how blockchain can you make a real time settlement at distribute
platform for everybody ok any questions on the use case yasu Dixit ACC that's right yeah ok so now so let's see what happens so I'm not getting into this and terminologies so I really what happens is
in the present right so everybody is interacting with the central house ok so there is so this party is there ok this company or individual whatever it is the transaction details here so they transact this details ok so they all have no Central from this clearing house in talks 2 laser update the details get the details post here you know that is the model which works right now ok please find its working fine ok
so what is that here is in a limited transparency what is the problem ok as I mentioned right 40 securities still suppose you know you are trying to break the system and suppose your adding in a very less likely ok so this is enough by adding a food security is very less likely but still there is a concern ok and another thing is information awesome I'm awesome entries
that is suppose you know you found out you might have heard about something call arbitrage ok so one exchange value will be less and other exchange value will be hai ok supposed say that I I have open something like a security board or something its called why why why Ok so here in if I try to manipulate prices just Google share
sointra $2000 I you know I tell 8500 dollars not charge more from the customer so sorry this only by the audit vouching repeated auditing getting the data scrutinizing that it is taking it is not true open this ok no idea blockchain is what we are looking it is ok and another main thing is for all these to work we are spending lot of Administration cost ok so millions of
so if that instead if it is a decentralized model that is if it is a blockchain based solution so everybody is in transparent and writing into the ledger anybody can read from ledger if if we change this to blockchain model we could save millions of dollars you know this counterparty risk will be completely solved even today we don't have it but these all can be solved ok so that's the that's it in this all will take
time for it to mature ok maybe probly it will take another 10 years old to measure but right now this thought process like and how we can make it a distributed and decentralized questions Sandeep question so good question will blockchain little directly interact
end user location as possible
what is the performance of this company and it is there is some kind of a trust ok probably SEBI is there in the future also but in the blockchain mode ok supposed to be is authenticating like you know Google is so that also can be seen in blockchain ok guys so know the idea right so this example like suppose you want to try
Ishwar Google security to ASR to someone's talk to someone ok so enjoy having a totally there is no middle man why are smart contracts and stuff what you can do this you can directly transfer ok so that we can chat and section if it is something like you know see you send Bitcoin to one person to another person similarly you send a stock from party toh party be so this is all possible through blockchain ok guys
got it so you can try in NASDAQ sometime back in 20 December 2016 they tried nastics some to test blockchain for me successfully complain I solve sometime in December
2016 ok so yes you can just Google and Google around and then find out there is lot of test which is being carried out we don't know yet like in a when this will go mainstream so basically you know that's what it is real time settlements it is the transparency these all things considered an of blockchain benefits of blockchain
ok so now will touch base Cryptography consensus algorithm for consensus will spend some time Cryptography I'll leave it to you basically will touch base and then can explore so what is cryptography in so it is nothing but you know which came up with
public and private key right so one has a public private key the very common most used was RC Rs inscription asli most of the computer students would be knowing like what is an RC encryption public key encryption so likewise there are other encryption is also like face to face is there a lot of algorithms ok so if you look at in Andheri I'm and Bitcoin world
do you some kind of encryption called its its Siddique nursery electrical sorry elliptical curve digital signing product like I said I use something else Ok then not using IC IC so so question from Rakesh blockchain is only for Bitcoin or general currency also we can implement its up to
blockchain is the concept ride is a concept so wherever you want you can implement suppose if you want to implement for see if you guys have seen and use venezula government ok if you look at when is your account and what they they created something called petrodollar ok so this petrodollar and so why they were created as they want to create a digital currency for their own country make sense so it is
after the government and it is possible make sense case Nokia is widely used Encryption Algorithm in blockchain technology no I think this is no it's a wrong statement ok so in blockchain technology widely elliptical curve is used
I'll just ask him to change it called elliptical curve problem send to the team ok so security of our
leave it to you when I find out like you know now we are anyway not anymore using RC used to know the advance of dissemination elliptical curve it's very hard to break okay if you want to find a private key they will tell you like in a flight will take hundred years or 110 years to find that key ok so now we will get into consensus algorithm ok any questions till
now so now so for next next half an hour what we're going to Look At Us consensus algorithm so we have seen like in a water so consensus is nothing but a coming to an agreement ok so this could be transactions it could be as awesome in within your team if you want to come to an agreement like you know
awesome places in the blockchain world and distributed ledger world ok so what are the consensus algorithms people are using right now so that is what we will look at for the next half an hour so we have seen proof of work there are other things called proof of elapsed time that is proof of stake SPB ft so these are algorithms you will look at it ok
ok so basically this consensus as I mentioned it is an hour it's an agreement or unanimous agreement between multiple parties what is that you are going to mutually agree upon ok so we look at on my own so concerned since is the heart of blockchain relocate traditional database ok so basically it is a commit you send a transaction
it'll be easier, Tora feel right so it the integrity everything is maintained by the administrator of the owner of the database correct here it is distributed in a one party cannot accept the transaction that should be multiple parties that ok is the transaction so we look at the different types of roots so basic parameters of a consensus mechanism ok so what all we know
what is a good consensus algorithm ok so first we need to have a decentralized consensus meaning that we are going blockchain is a multi party in traction system so single authority should not be able to show that will have to take care and performance ok so if you look at proof of work in that case what proof of work it takes more time ok so it may not be fitting in all other needs ok so we'll have to take care of performance
fault tolerance in a it should be Unbreakable ok so privacy solve these parameters ok nonrepudiation this important that is like suppose you initiate a transaction ok and it is say that say that it the transaction in non repeatable for transaction is initiated is there forever ok again we should not be able
initiate the same type of transaction so these are the basic things now we will look at the algorithm message ok first we will look at Byzantine so its called Byzantine generals problem how many of you have played a game called good game Mercy your
there is a board game where you find out the thieves this a very good game have you any one plate that board game in fact that is a TV series also so it's basically game where you can find out the thieves and People Act thieves and some will let me know they will try to be
the network is very good game I think it's small anything yeah Soch call Merlin ok so we are going to look at in a some kind of inertia why you want to say this if you have worked me know if you play this game
be very easy to just correlate ok fine then I will go to the water God On We're Going to Look At Us Byzantine fault tolerance ok bebe ft formation practical Byzantine fault tolerance ok so this is algorithm we are going to see ok so this algorithm is it is a simple story ok so that is in this
story there is a army general they have a plan ok the plan is 4 they want to there is a food here this is nothing but we can see the spot right so should I D as they all want to attack the Fort OK so the
Anas there there they need to take the food there are 505 who are going to involved in this attack ok each one is going to come from a different directions say that there is one or whatever I call OK I will call anyone ok simple so there is anyone Army
Army one Army 2 Army 3 4 and 5 ok ok so 12345 OK so the idea is each one has an
Army location is Nami they are all planning to attack the food but what happens is so everyone is in a different location around the city they are in a different locations so what will happen if each one this army general will send one person to communicate their plan of attack to Army to ok sorry I cannot Army to another so that they all come to a plan ok so tomorrow 5 A.M
idhar bhi attack or we don't attack they'll have to come up with the unanimous agreement ok there is only 5 people they all are located in a different parts of the city ok and how do they come to an agreement ordered located at a different place what they went to do is there going to send a courier to communicate the plan to the rest of the rest of the army members here there is a common rule ok it's a rule the rulers
majority or treaters you cannot come to an agreement in this case letters say that the three are traitors okay 3 or treaters it doesn't mean you are always the traitor is going to win the majority majority of traitors right so we can't do anything so that rate is good in a treatise good been and they will lose the Fort ok they can't go to the plan ok but in this scenario
so this if there is a scenario like know the majority or 2:30 or treaters you know this algorithm you know I will feel ok That Should Be Me no more number of good people so that's the basic criteria OK so the next one is supposed that is 3 that is so let's say that there are three good people
3 good and to traders ok so what happens like a let's say that Army 4 and 5 IST traitor ok so these are retreaders others are good people ok so now what will happen is so each one will send a courier will send a courier to find out what has happened ok no say that damn E4 has reached Army on 1st and say that you know let's say that lets a knot a tie
ok ok not a tackle its not attack or will see attack where they all want to attack but Army one is thinking that we should not attack ok because they see that in the army strength is not good they are playing on not attack so they are sending a information to another another so they have decided like not attack ok so seeing this case what happens is so
Dev decision not attack this person are me too also as decided not a tag ok so in this case not attack so this is not attack on this is not a tag on it so theres good people that thinking that does not attack ok but these guys wants to attack you can Over Me 4% reach here and says that attack ok and here also you know he reaches soon and he says that attack attack
you keep saying that you can everyone has to decision take a decision whether to attack or not attack in this is what happens is our meetings okay Army for Acid it's attack so let's go and attack ok if you make that decision you would go wrong right you would go wrong ok are you are we getting the story before I continue
fine you getting it right so practically in this case what we should do is ok ok good so what happens is in this scenario we should take a decision right one has to take a decision to move the plan or not with the plan ok if anyone anyone cannot make a decision on himself just he is thinking not at not to attack but if she gets attack attack from other things he might get
confused like what to do you know what are options I have people say suppose this to cory's things that you know he has received our tax Army 4 and 5 OK then in this case any things ok I should also take any changes the plan of attack and anna and then send the courier like in water then it becomes a problem right they will fail the mission OK so the solution to it
solution to that is how this can be solved is first I should take my own decision ok so my decision here in this case is not attack ok and I should take get all others decision ok so what is ur me to say ok I'm not trust anybody remember I should not trust anybody Army to saying not attack I should get everyone's opinion ok Army 3 is saying not attack
ok because I am a good person so I know that I should not attack no 4 and 5 4 and 5 says attack then what I should think is no problem it go with not attack ok so likewise everyone has to make up a decision my decision and I'll have to collect rest of the Other decision then come to an agreement and then go with the plan of action so 55 a.m there is no discussion he thinks I this is
my plan I am not going to attack to people have said did not attack so you know tomorrow morning 5 a.m I am not going to go ok so that's the you know that is the idea of it are you getting in so this is the PB ft algorithm winner Byzantine fault tolerance algorithm OK what about general Army what about army general distance or army general cannot make a
Foundation Swami generals is decision is not a tag ok but he will have to wait for others decision then he will decide on what to do ok this idea ok so there is a good example that you know where this algorithm is used in the real time okay suppose think that is a spam attack I couldn't remember the top of my head let me try to find out and tell you
next class but I love it when your computers interact between networks right so it's all connected interconnected so if there is a spam message or something ok so whether I have to forward this message or not forward to those those decisions are made by your system computers ok and transferring a packet of transferring so I'll find out that example I don't remember at the top of my head break time of something else
find that out ok so and what they claim is right so what they claim this pbf the algorithm of the claim is more number of users you get into the network OK it is good for the network so now we have our only army fight this just Army you can take this for anything suppose we have like Army 2000 exam pattern thousands of big big network and you are going
Cuttack major Capital city or something like that ok so there is 10000 small Armies then in this case it is in it is unanimously agreed factor that when you bring in more and more people ok so that'll be more good people only ok so this is just that is all we consider it so that it we are coming into an agreement to bring more people then be more validators we think that there will be more
good people and we share the knowledge like you know whatever Beatles it is based on that we will always take a good decision so this is the algorithm is shit but still if there are two thirds Arthritis in of this algorithm first. This is there are two thirds of craters this will feel ok but for other scenario this is going to work ok I will take up questions
so that is what is mentioned here no solution exists if less than or equal to 2 3rd general knowledge questions I am not get I'm not getting any questions either your wall understood are you haven't
ok Shailendra says find Dennis how do you know who is loyal or not ok we don't know it we don't know who are liar LOL who is not loyal only thing is a collective decision making we get distance from different people and you take your opinion also and then you come to the impression that how this network works in certain things that's what the real time
let me try to find out real time please
ok let let me not go into that it's ok so let's not waste time on it I will try to find out that example ok next week let me or tomorrow I will get
so question from home Kaun like which means that is probability of keeping a traitor into network there could be a possibility that traitors are there but if he if the enough it is less than 2 by third OK then how do we come to a common agreement how do we always win so that study of the circle
Anand Kumar here it says to wait 3 or Royal to be 3 or Royal it will not work is it though there saying if it means that it is wrong no solution exists if less than an object old other way less than or equal to 2 by 3 general sir
it should be not loyal actually ok that's wrong the basic concept is majority should not be treated ok did you very down so still how do you make a final decision in the example 3 Army have decided
that it is not attack ok so now what is the majority so conclusive patient is here if you see not attack not attack not a text someone decides he is not a type similarly Army to do the same thing Army 3 would do the same thing find me it'll be not attack maybe you can think like there is only 5 here example what we're shows only 5 but in real time scenario there will be a lot of participants
that's right ok ok this next test solution so solution is so Dennis in blockchain concept does this mean of the majority rejects the answer the block will be rejected that's right yes DNS
question from Mallika we saw that consensus algorithm we is consensus organised where we differentiate public and not necessary basically we find out the plan we're trying to understand what are the different types of cancers the consensus algorithm is are there so that
can use it in a network ok so so when a node receives a message they use in and they maintain a internal state and UP on that day you know there is a message from others then then then they make a decision whether to attack on on this case ok so here you see concern
station is determined based on the total decision submitted by all notes and so the majority make sense is so now going on like you know we'll see like why we need different consensus algorithm so when I asked he mentioned before like you know each system is different so your use cases different at one place you think that you know this
mechanics PDF Toshiba find another place is there something called draught algorithm proof of stake for each one comes up with an algorithm okay Suvichar suits your needs in terms of performance and we supposed 1 things like you know EPF TMI network I think that'll be more number of traitors okay supposed just imagine that we have the same thing in Bitcoin suppose we have bebe ft in Bitcoin and let's say that there are more number of traitors OK then what will happen easily
Kannada can be hard but what they are choosing their choosing something like you know I don't agree what you say you solve the puzzle solve the puzzle you need to spend computer effort ok see in that case we can't doesn't trust anybody ok whatever you say doesn't matter you do computation were you find out what is the number of zeros in that case proof of work is a very good Alka make sense so depending upon the use case and needs one has to choose the title colour
were you able to correlate why this pbf t won't work in Bitcoin next Swapan to look at proof of stake ok so what is proof of stake
ok so if theory I'm ready sorry I was trying to move into proof of stake so that's a planetarium right now uses proof of work but they are trying to move to proof of stake ok so why they want to move is first of all for each block confirmation it takes 10 minutes ok and the amount of so that is a performance Aisa and the next
nurse lot of power wastage so it is translated that so the entire Bitcoins power right the electricity consumption is equivalent to entire ireland's not Ireland icelands electricity requirement so that much amount of electric electricity is spent on proof of work so if everybody is going to run on proof of work algorithm then you know will be
ceiling surplus amount of electricity which we don't want to do that ok so in like in ethereum doesn't want to do that so they are coming up with algorithm card proof of stake ok so what is proof of stake is in 20 algorithms are very complex and if you want to Deep dive into it right you know what it is how it works mathematically love to spend an invite amount of time like to and now these all what I like how we have seen proof of the number of
I like that you look at a level like what what is algorithm stage show proof of stake what it says is as the name suggests take ok if you need to participate ok in mining activity you need to want some Steak that is if you have for example 25000 metres
then only you can then only you can make it so thats that will be said before ok and what will happen is these 25 features will be locked by the contract ok so he will be proving that I have this amount of ethers and phenols it'll be want buy this contract for a while and then so like then people will start in a minor valid
transaction okay moment it is found out that this person has cheated okay he has status coins yes take this kind should definitely he is not going to lie ok because he is going to lose this pic ok so so basically and then he makes a transaction he find out let me know what is the you know what is there any well that's all the transaction in distributed through the network and network ok
so this is proof of stake ok still you will be is solving the number and all but ill be only few participants so difficult period will be very very less will be only few minus will be participating in the proof of stake algorithm reason being there clean and asking want to clean lot of Steak so this case you feel ok for example if you like a 25000 or 9 today there be
number of minutes ok once they move to proof of stake there will be only limited number of minus but there is a problem here the problem what is the problem is so even though this is good this is going to make your transaction faster this clean slate again you know we are in a back to you know which model I can come capitalism and whoever home loans mistake they are allowed okay suppose you have 10 metres in a you will not
hello to participate ok so this is a problem with it ok but still even though they have 25000 metres still it is open like what their mining what their introducing to the network those are all sim and no one is stopped from being participate anybody can participate if they have that much amount of questions
shooting Anand Dinesh Gayathri Sandeep Sudheer Vilas MCA don't see any questions so we are good then ok so this is proof of stake algorithm OK so the next one so the next question
sorry the next Alka remote we are going to look at us there is a question from Mallika if the - are restricted it's more like controlling it is that's what people claim and what the sitter in phases see our purpose is to solve the winner make the transactions faster and you know it is still it is open whatever people are validating is still open see today what is happening is when we save it
Android Bitcoin anybody can mine but really do you think we can mine know to build such amount of mining power we need to spend a lot of amount which we are not going to do anyway right so many so then why worry here also its the same but in a weird huh today who are mine still there able to see like you know what is getting my Indian also same thing is NC in proof of stake also question from soup
rain proof of stake will the minor have to stay call their Holdings for mining A block not all their kinds so it could be like some certain amount so so this algorithm is not released in the market it ok still it is in the development stage it is expected that end of 2018 that could be a release so how much is the amount I don't have no clue in case I want to gain Steak then that means that I need
coins that's right Gayatri so IMP from Sudhir questions so IM proof of stake - make money only in transactions no no no it is again blocked mining everything will happen but only thing even to participate he should on certain amount of coins
Sadar be mining ripple mining Rig everything will be there only what will happen is that Top Notch people only they get the reward suppose they say that you love to have 1 ml say like only 10 dinner then are going to participate in something something in the next 1 years
show proof of work vs proof of stake you see like the examples peercoin so proof of work you take you perform calculations find out in electricity all the expenses can find out the answer ok so here who has most Ek they find out it and hear you see if they want to attack the net
they should own a major number of coins ok even if they want major number of Kansas The Attack the network just taking their kind if they attack it is there is no use at all do you lose everything ok so delegated proof of stake ok so now people thought like ok proof of stake is good but you know there is lot of problem because you are claiming that you know
only who has majority number of coins can participate in said there is another algorithm which is so these are all in the influences stage ok so these are white papers these are not completely implemented and into production at what delegate delegate proof of stake claims that ok let everyone participate ok so there can be something like a electrical in a Run in real time let an election kind of things have happened and will select
Zombie proof of stake but not like you're not 25000 inches or something like that maybe it would be like 10 metres in as simple as that you will have to prove your stay but who is going to validate so that will be selected based on the electrol procedure so so that another main idea of them is like they want to evenly distributed to everybody not not the maturity holders
yes that is delegated proof of stake ok so next ok so next one is proof of elapsed time so this is developed by Intel ok so they are also getting into blockchain platform it is called short tour
hyperledger sawtooth ok so that is that is a platform there coming up with and what people playing was that you know it is going mitotic fabric OK it is better than that that's what people in fabric what happened there architecture at become somewhat Complex ok and if you look at the fabric the relation release there. 621 there n tier architecture changed from 1 to 1.1 day button
there are doing a lot of complexity so Intel comes up with something like this algorithm is called proof of elapsed time what they give is similar to proof of work what they give us they give you and parcel to solve but this person has to be solved in your own machine ok so if you look at another it is a Revolution actually look at this one software God extensions and you know read more about it
ok trusted execution environment and it will true so that is for example in our class say that everyone has this internship ok and everybody will be given some kind of a person what will have to do with you'll have to run the special in your own machine and find out light and everyone has to report like who has solved first ok so based on that this condition consensus algorithm works
but for this consensus all remember you for this consensus algorithm to work you'll have to install this software called stx and top of it you should have a hardware called the hardware which supports this trusted execution environment locations this one kind of alcohol
so these are some of the advantages to the main advantage what I see is this API in on this trusted execution environment so Jason why is it called proof of elapsed time so who finds before the time lapses so that's not that's why it's called proof of time proof of elapsed
you are given a puzzle and you know the counter starts before that who is trying to solve the puzzle some that's why it's called a proof of elapsed time every good so Vamsi villas I don't see any question from your be good Sandeep
Nokia so Dennis does this mean we can choose which consensus algorithm to apply near Model yeah so I know it's not in this hyperledger fabric analysis go to and I refuse fabric ok so they gave they provide you like plug-n-play consensus algorithm if you want to use pbf to your good to go depending upon your use case you can select the consensus algorithm also your whole chain
if you look at it haram Bitcoin it is always proof of work it's a public changed it always operation prefer if you use fabric OK your network you think that PV ft will suit your requirement then you know you can choose PB ft it's so modular if you want to go for. You can choose that there any like proof of elapsed time is used nowadays in I'm still ongoing it is Intel platform
cities around going so it's not completely release to public it Shailendra like does algo depends on business case that's right yeah I got it depends on business case right now let's move on sorry good we are done with the consensus algorithm now we are going to look at you not types of blockchain
ok ok so what are the blockchain types basically write like you know when you look at cloud also previously miss you might be knowing about cloud so cloud what they gave there is a public cloud OK then there was a private cloud that is
in your organisation there is a hybrid cloud something is public something is private ok something like that here also there is types of blockchain ok so what is public blockchain Bitcoin for example everything is public write anybody can participate anybody can initiate transaction social public anybody can participate in mining so this is completely public blockchain so next one is private so anything which you want to close he used within your organisation not to anybody then it becomes a private blockchain ok
external world will not know like to know what your blockchain what your what is your data nothing they would know so then next third type as a construction blockchain it is nothing but a group of people come together and they create a Consortium blockchain platform where only specific counterparts can register for example if you take curd as an example ok Karda create a blockchain platform for all Financial Institutions
so in this corner platform Bank of America can register ok but suppose if you say that car company like BMW they can't go register OK it is meant only for Financial Institutions they have a platform for their own way on purpose or something like that is popularly for medicinal drugs find out this drug related stuff ok Pharmaceutical so then
we can participate in that only does farmer related companies can participate in that so that was Consortium based blockchain ok make sense question ok next test permission and permission less blockchain permission there's nothing but I know as the name indicates in you want to participate in a blockchain there are some rules
ok I mentioned right like if someone wants to participate in Kota not everybody can participate ok there are some rules no problem it's a bank you will have to support some things and their laughter show their network has some capability only then they can get participants of this basically permission permission listener like anybody can Bitcoin anybody can go participate right so that is permissionless
and if you look at another. Which I wanted to see if you look at the permission login world that will be defined validators or minus ok so I suppose BMW is running a network ok blockchain network where he wants all the vendors to participate in that is open and stuff like that not suppose there is a person whose validating and making the participant
Myntra done the blockchain okay fabric manufacturer come can comment so some someone has a control power who adds the participant to blockchain ok so that tall is information doubled ok some kind of control would be there question from Shailendra blockchain is actually a China
top 10 vi individual has to register a year does it mean network so why you have to register SIP Bitcoin Acer full of blocks but if you want to make a transaction in your lap register right you have to have a public you'll have to download your wallet that save it works so in the support in blockchain enterprise world if you want to participate then yes you'll have to be registered on network
San Francis operation Shailendra so public and private ok so so everybody has open so this is permission okay speedways public is relative Lee slower than compared to private because there is no proof of work nothing like that ok so public proof of work proof of stake private like in a pre-approval
you know who you suppose if you take code as an example only some banks or can participate not others identity it is also gonna miss you got to get all these numbers but in a private world it is known identities so I said its native vs native assessment Republic you can say that I should take Bitcoins only Bitcoin to take it anymore it is only 13 here you can create whatever I said so for example
Nizam blue check if we know BMW swimming Dede contract parts so part is an asset that ok ok Break season as I understood that's right Shailendra user has to receive 212 that's right so question from Denise if its private blockchain will it still be anonymous it should normally it won't be anonymous okay the reason being you are going to
participate with unknown participants only so if you take BMW network ok if you just done all the suppliers multiple vendors they will have a list they can't be anonymous because they are receiving that you know this is a break I produce this is the serial number I just got in there no night in its ok ok
show public and private Saugandh were presented in a different way public goes till 2 federated private ok so what are the types of permission list to permission again this different types it celebrated in a different way that moving on
site change another type of blockchain so this one will look what it is so the ideas are we good can we motorcycle question from Hong Kong like to define weather is public or Private Limited be you define ok so depending upon the you
yes so if you a few BMW right so it's their internal network so they cannot go public they take their use case can this be a public and what do they want to achieve in terms of blockchain to and they decide upon it snow in a diesel in inside there is a concept call sightseeing ok out the problem with one of the major problem with blockchain like
companies like Microsoft is trying to solve is nothing but in fact If you look at Microsoft they are not keen and creating blockchain platform ok so it is already there at ok it's already there and they don't want to get into it so they are trying to build a top player on top of it like in a how do multiple change can interact today if you see you there in blockchain you can only interact with him ok can only transfer E3
if I want to transfer ethereum to Bitcoin ok how does that work ok how can I How do multiple change how can multiple change interact with each other this is just a concept this is where the real breakthrough in which is expected to come in this year in Microsoft is trying to announce something by end of June ok bye then we'll see there is lot of research going on
as mentioned is called coco Framework ok so let's see how this thing solve cooker Framework trusted execution in 20 days are going to be in a groundbreaking this year so now side change site change the concept of side chain is suppose if you want to transfer from one if you want to transfer to Bitcoin network how how does that work so so that is in its called to a
because that is searching here and you know interacts with other thing so that's which colour to wear for a pic ok and so between you can see a simple circle here ok so here that is something called its called spv single sorry simple payment verification so I will directly go to the subject so if you look at
today's right suppose if you have a stock market is an example Nasdaq stock exchange to interact with suppose it needs to find out who your identity then it will be in a separate blockchain OK your identity is all stored in another thing if Bitcoin Sudhir kinds are stored in one thing so that will be not in home now but in years down the line there be multiple change interacting with each other ok
sidechain is a concept Dev develop to some extent but this has to go through several faces to get you completely production ready now the idea is so there is something called in a stack there something LOL ask this just imagine that this is a token ok and are enough for that reason you can I assume it is either also supposed from other network
you want to transfer to a bitcoin address then what happens if it's a simple concept okay what they do is there is a side chain OK what it does is let's take that Shailendra has some other and he wants to transfer to Denise ok so what happens if you take a bitcoin address and then you send it what happens Eda in San Andreas either so what happens if the this eat
this transaction goes to the centre place is called simple payment verification ok that another chain holds that ok this just transfer is successful I hold this ok now I will find out whether dense as a real Bitcoin address if it is there the conversion takes place then releases the payment there ok some kind of so in between here rights in this place
you know it confirms and then it since can some kind of a notification ok so this is the concept of side chains see this is not completely Monopoly products and ready there is lot of things going on I don't want you to go go deep into it ok there any other topics which will look but highly I want you to understand that there is a problem with the current scenario multiple blockchain interaction that is a problem but we need to solve
site changes one such solution solution not a hundred percent solution so what they are trying to do they are they are having another chain which Run suppose you want to transfer from either to any kind any kind they take care take care of it they are test intermediate Re take your coins hold for sometime and then you know sent to the other address ok so that's how it works today
high level were you able to understand the concept of what site saying is trying to solve ok good so cocos for side chain solution Shailendra no cook a caucus trying to address some kind of side chain solution it is trying to pull data from external world if you look at blockchain today rate
so when can it is more of a update only ok so you see till now what we have seen it is all transaction you add some data and to blockchain right it is not that your data is not pulled over pulled from external world ok so we spoke about smart contracts in everything it is like Yusuf it's the data that becomes a transaction what a transaction requires external data okay how can that be pulled in those
aspects Coco Framework is developed being developed so some popular platforms these are some of the platforms so in our class in this world will be looked at it therium will in a practical standpoint will look at it really look and multichain will look at hyperledger
you look at all these three ok so these are other things there are lot a lot of platforms that is Hydra change there is there something called middle age there is hyperledger sawtooth Lake there is hyperledger iroha landlord platforms ok but there is something call primechain Mein many platforms ok but currently if you look at it industry wise they're trying to use it Aryan multichain
intelsat to play and hyperledger in all this I O tires for guess you might be knowing internet of things right that is so like a smart watch smart washing machine stuff like that ok how do those interact those devices interact with blockchain so that is iota used
Ja Tara Ta nahi lekin blockchain for save the blocks that is for all all the coins related to BTC that's right anything you say is in blockchain info its all exclusively for Bitcoin okay make sense so various platform for implementing blockchain other platforms honest big change DB
K Sera Sera seen this Koda Koda is for what Financial Institutions ok so there coming about the platform quorum so quorum sensing but JP Morgan right Sudeep JP Morgan what they thought it will take it anymore so platform ok they are 4 bit basically they have taken all there its name is open source they taken that code and their creating a preparatory out of it like how Linux Linux open source but it is taken by sun Solaris and they have their own
action is taken by IBM and they have a similar to that Korum is created by JP Morgan by buttering platform is ethereum and Stella is for payment ok still has called Stellar lumens it's called it is used for all the payment related stuff there trying to come up to the platform
Shukur sundarana so then what about other kind Can we see blocks of other currency of we can see just me you need to Google find out so suppose if you want to look at it area Italy Embassy 3rd standard are you ok like blockchain that info beta blockers Pari task and other kinds other block Explorer
ok so 9:55 let's have lunch hour 10 minute break okay a long time then will go on to the module 3 ok in module 3 so lets go lets after the break let's continue go to model 3 ok so now it's 9:55 let's meet at 10 v
ok guess its get started no I haven't started yesterday question from silent I think everyone try
blockchain developer blockchain architect are in AP NGOs in ICU advisor if you are good at public blockchain one can you know if you are interested in cryptocurrency people could do they are just doing trading on in Bitcoin and other currencies there are lot of options available Jason she is that anything you are specifically looking at
ok fine now in this class what we are going to look at this we have next don't know so basically we are going to look at Bitcoin it's again this module 3 and module 4 is all about again it's about Bitcoin ok so module 3 will get started with the what is Bitcoins his
ok we have already seen so some of the slides in I want spend much time ok and we will look at wallet creation in this class OK will look at that and then there is a play in a hole like it in 20 slides of like where you can spend Bitcoin ok so that I leave it to you know. Just explain like y'all you can spend probly you can look at one or two then leave it to you then what we are going to Lucas how
different types of wallets so I can share my experience with the wallet for defence college and at the end of this class I don't know whether will have time to send off this last what we look at us we will look at transactions what are we look that Bitcoin as a block on a Sunny not till now we talked about Block what happens with a block level 2 - the block
how block is getting changed now we are going to look at transaction level what happens when you initiated transaction OK what all details does a transaction contain however who verifies this transaction so that level we will look and good in the next module so tomorrow what we look at you will deep dive into mining concepts OK what is mining me we have already seen what is mining what are the different types of mining is mining a good option for me you know what is pulled me
so we look at mining concepts so these are the two models will look so what is bitcoin ok so Bitcoin is nothing but not till now we have seen what is bitcoin in the history we know that why Bitcoin came into existence ok because of the you know if you look
the banking system problem based on that 10 min Bitcoin came into picture so it is said that you know Bitcoin start was started Way back into 2009 end of 2009 before that in 2008 there was two banks which got crashed right you know that Merrill Lynch and Lehman brothers ok so what happened this people have deposited money into the bank UK and
and a lot of us taxpayers a spade lot of amount as tax write so all those amount was taken and what happened this to bank scratch and there was a total economy was down and you know in spite of you give when amount to maintain your account or you give me always keep that Bank takes that amount and they leave it for interest that's of the whole circle works OK then what happened even after that
us was no still they use the taxpayers money Infuse funds to this Bank so that they can come to the sweet sleep so you are saying when accessories and we pay taxes so that in our roads are better our infrastructure gets better then find lead you to banking issues internally in because of their issues it was gone down our tax money is going there in a that some people say that you know that so so she got frustrated and then
this all we can't ok so tired ok so Bitcoin is the first as you all know by now you know it's the first digital currency so quick history is one person name satoshi nakamoto is name is he was trying to he created this digital money Bitcoin ok so what has happened is initially he had written as a blog and was created this white paper and he started but once have after sometime when people
understood that you know he threw blocks and things he said that dinner this is what the concept is once people start started to understand this is a concept then you know he is no more when I say no more he did not write anything he mentioned that he has left to right person and then he just vanished we never know we don't know like who is really Santoshi nakamoto or whether his name is really satoshi nakamoto weather is from
Japan Sona Singh is known it whether he has died no idea it ok but people claim that all his blog post where you're not during North America day time so people say that he know he could be from North America not from Asia is all speculations but nothing is known as we know that this white paper came from my name called University in your computer so that's all we know about
ok so bad so there is no centralise authority so ja 2008 paper posted in October then I think ok I said wrongly I didn't 2009 at it all started in 2009 then you know the first transaction you see people have spend in 15000 Bitcoins for getting pizza
then you know how things were and those times us had biggest exchange called as mum on Cox and Cox so they were the biggest exchange and they filed bankruptcy because they claim that you know there once was stolen and still the case is going on still that is 8 and 20:11 so that was again you know there was a big drop
people biorefining out that beat coins were used for some drug trafficking and other illegal things so there was no crack down and then on the weekend price and hit bottom again so that's when Silk Road is called Silk Road people I don't have you guys heard about dark web so there is a very good night video about it dark web you can you not listen to it so
so this was it so this is a quick easy like what all happened and right now you see when the slide when the slide was prepared it was 2500 so right now you know it went up to in the last class of m a previous match it hit up to $21,000 and right now it is
so someone if you have invested I might be knowing like you know what is going on so why use Bitcoins so we have already seen this it's fast and I will not still climb that it is fast fast but if you see terms of settlement transferring from one party to another party does all real time settled but if you
transfer from Bank of America to say some other bank what happens if there is a lot of settlement which happens behind the scenes over the weekend or on IT jobs something like that runs and only then settlement happened takes place ok and its cheap in a transaction fee is a very minimal we all know that ok so right now if you see transaction fees are more ok if you want to transfer a small amount of Bitcoin the end
construction fees are more ok but eventually there saying it will come down but in case if you want to send a large sum of money that it is cheaper ok and no charge backs so chargebacks if you look at in the credit card world you can buy something special in US and we can buy something and if the product is not there you can just cancel the whole another process is right so that is no charge back once you transferred is transferred and
payment security when it solve based on public private key no one wants it so no Bank owns it so no one can steal your friend until unless you lose your private ownership is on you and it's in film a tree so it's a very good. So if you look at rest of the current seat solve printer more and more so if for us wants to print so many million dollars they are you know based on demand supply the print sales
similar to any other country for that matter but if you look at Bitcoin it is only 21 million ok and this 21 million when will it reach it will reach in at 21:40 so in the year 2009 it was probly essence and right now how much is the value of it it is 8 o'clock almost $21,000 what is it expected it is expected up to it can go up to $56,000 ok you never know any anything could come
Som Sudha do you know the price of one bitcoin value will be so high that a no its inflationary currency that is your valuable increase so if you're supposed today in today's world if you have $100 bill it is always $100 10 years after all so it is and adorable but Bitcoin is not like that if you hold a one bitcoin now it could be $2,000 we know it could cost $50,000 10 years from
no I can come too many $1 in it depends have lot of other factors are there so its private create your money its ok and you can create your own what do you mean is if you can mind you can create your own money so that's about it and why use Bitcoins ok basically like there is no sir
party right there is no middle man there is a transaction fees are minimal also Bitcoins cannot be stolen because your Bitcoin will always stay in chain it will be always in your blockchain so if you forget your key nothing can be done otherwise you can find out ok so that's about so no tracking so no one knows she today just imagine if you had Bitcoins like who has
suppose this and in India might have for face chal I get there was a reason scam that Punjab National Bank that was a huge crowd right so you have spent a lot of time when you are done your script of money but still it is not safe right you'll have to pay so much fees for to keep your money and that money also its lent out for interest so you look at Bitcoin ok so it's you and and you have it if you want you spend it that kind of
Richard total total economic the way we locate economic model little fish story different in any questions feel year questions from home yeah that's fine we're phone hacked have to believe that when I'm ok
again I want to inform you that 10 or next class also will be starting at 7:30 no just hold on for me for next batch also you know then let's try to catch up thank you where and how to buy Bitcoins ok so so I don't know like I think I think most of you are from US and India like if you are from any other country let me know just being me
Om so where you can buy is us go to places coinbase in India there is a lot of place you can buy you can show the way you could buy is either you can meet a person give cash and then buy Bitcoin are you go register it to exchange transfer cash and then buy Bitcoin or if you have the mining hardware in enough equipment then you can mine and get the Bitcoin ok these are
ways you can acquire Bitcoin ok so denilson me from Singapore Singapore I don't know what exchange you have that is something called belfrics I don't know how popular it is he can use that and or if there is a good exchange please let me know
Kishore De saare options so I think Mallika has mentioned about coinbase right can you let me know like you know what is that you want to know about coinbase in WhatsApp
ok done assignment or not ok fine ok good so now Bitcoin clients ok so what is bitcoin client again there are a lot of clients available ok so if you look at blockchain there are lot of blocks right so right now we are in the 500 mm ok ok if you want to store all those blocks in your machine it will take
lot of memory from liya like 10 gig or 15 gig it will take but you think like you know I am and user I don't worry about it I just want to wear and lightweight client you know that option is also available ok so you can run lightweight client full client you have the interviewer download all the blockchain ok so this one web client is more of a exchange sort of thing like you know you have on your all your coins in the exchange and
you private key resides there and they maintain it so different types of Clans are there I will share the group to join somewhere I had it all shareit
space if you have any anyone stored the WhatsApp link right now can you just message me when I'm not the WhatsApp in the system if you are stored the should adjust in Saturday so next is mobile clients now we are all moving into a mobile is right so even the usage of Institute
used computers but we use people do mobiles a lot so even you can use a mobile client so that a lot of what is available today ok so I got it I will send to a group now you can join us to use this link to join
today so why not join ok so there are various so Bitcoin wallets people are creating out of wallets let's look at some of the wallets in this class ok so I will give an idea of what what are these wallets ok so there are different wall its ok web wallet it's basically you have
Gabbar is it used to everything in your exchange ok so mobile wallets in as the name States you can have it in mobile desktop wall its ok you can I can show you have a disturb but I can show you a hardware wallet in hardware wallet is like you used to there is a small USB like device where you store your Bitcoins there Bitcoins earning coins there and you know your private key receipts that doesn't go anywhere so next one is paper wallet
paper wallets are the safest once and multi signature wallets multisig wallet she's nothing but that is suppose if you want to initiate some transaction fund transfer to people have to enter the key ok just like in a first person authenticates and second person enters the key then only the transaction gets released so that is multi signature wallet ok
so question from the Rani while transferring coins in exchange how public private key concept works I am just entering the destination address and sending how public and Phoebe maintain a totally different thing ok so what they do is so they create an address for you ok and the private keys to the store it outside ok so they basically it's all delete with public private key so that's why
able to send funds ok but your private key is stored by your exchange someone else okay in fact If you look at Indian Exchange ok so they do it in a totally different way what they do is me know what day do they give you a temporary address where you can store you know send your friends ok you you will be shown that you have fun ok but ultimately what they do they take it out
said OK the story tells where and then once you request and if you want to initiate a transfer then you can transfer they won't show the address also because just for the security purpose so these are some of the wallets your hardware different dual its ok so this is called ledger Nano so very
just hold on a minute ok so let me find out this Exodus wallet thing for York and showed up
ok guys just music
ok so there is no 1 hardware wallet is called ledger wallet teaser trailer is also another hardware wallet ok so you know this is this to a popular hardware wallets ok so Treasure wallet comes with something like good to factory they have something for two factor authentication ledger Nano comes with the hardware switch ok so what you should do is so if you want to send some account some Bitcoins if you
how to transfer from your wallet in have to do a push button ok that should be either way push ok in the wall at once you click on that then only a transaction gets initiated ok any questions yeah you can do that Sudhir is asking can I transfer funds from web wallet to Paypal wallet you can do anything for every wallet comes with the public private key
only thing is you will have to remember that you need to know which public you are trying to send and you should remember your private that is all its that is always required so Krishnan from Sri does exchange is made in private key for each user or one private key for exchange it is per user ok so so these are thought to all its or nothing
software wallets ok so you might see a desktop alerts reserved hot OLX this class will see like the way you look at Jaxx wallet so which is comparison which is a very good wallet ok in terms of safety hardware wallet is best because it's always there and paper wallet is also best
any questions so let's look at this Jaxx wallet ok we all let's do a practical session after boring is the recession liquid Jaxx wallet ok just open Google Chrome
ok so after I hope all of your following you can just typing Jaxx wallet Chrome ok so once you do that will get Jacks chain wallet ok just added to the Chrome to add extension
is Nokia following for some reason it's taking time ok it's not ok so once you click on this wallet
you please repeat so you know nothing what you love to do open your Google Chrome browser ok and type Jaxx wallet Chrome ok you click on this will get installed
ok now click on this Jacks click on it once you click this would get opened ok now click on this except ok so that is two options ok one is create a new wallet offer restore to wallet so that is
if you want suppose you created wallet here and you are stored all the way private keys details ok and suppose if you want to get rid of this computer and if you want to use a new computer in you can do restore ok so I will that live that you I'll give the concept you can try out like you know how to restore send now let's continue their custom options that stores Express continue
now what all model coins I would like to receive what I'm going to do is bitcoin and ethereum take me to my wallet ok so I am forgetting about all the tips now it is created ok so if you look at my Bitcoin address ok you can see this one this is my public key now I have created an account ok if someone wants to transfer me Bitcoins
you can send to this address as simple as that ok so and suppose if you want to know what is your ETA ammeter is ok let's click on this you get your ethereum address ok and if someone wants to transfer funds to you ok you'll have to share this ok and if they want to if you want to
urethra if I should share this ok ok so you can choose like a no from you can copy this address
all the stuff you can do ok and the question is where is a private key ok and if you want to send you know you have some amount if you if you want to send to somebody then you can click on send and enough I suppose if I want to send it to Jason I can copy here and send this and procedure ok now let's get into the private key so I am getting questions like where do I find the private key ok give me a minute
we know why so I can see your lake view and export private key ok now I am going to do this I understand
show display price display keys Ok why its not showing up see here so this is my private key ok so once you know this case then I know it's as good as you can take out when and if you know this private key can take it from me so base
what we do if you export and keep it then you can restore from other place make sense ok so fine I will repeat it ok so nothing fancy so I have added to Chrome click on this ok so first time when you set up your last
CBR strike whether you want to restore or create a new one we have created a new one what we need to do basically if you have a bank account number whether you will have to send funds to someone or someone will send it to you ok if you want to send to someone click on send enter the address enter the amount send ok it's done and if you want to receive ok give them this address to someone or me know if suppose you have it in your mobile you can show you show to people so that they
can your QR code on the same damn ok ok I suppose if you want to know backup your private keys here tools display private keys this is where you can look at that
Vikas ok make sense so question from Sudheer I have 1 BTC in Jax web wallet and I move it to paper wallet what happens that's my BTC Motu cold storage or does the whole Jax web wallet Motu cold storage will the paper wallet have different public key private key everything when we say wallet it it has a pair of keys
public key and private key so and understand that you are bitcoins it is not stored by Jaxx wallet ok Jaxx wallet what does is it gives you an address is your public and private key ok but ultimately your Bitcoin stored in blockchain ok so Jaxx wallet it goes find out what is very sure public displays this is your amount when you send it to your paper
wallet you are basically sending to that account that will be there forever if you want to send transaction from that paper wallet ok so you need to know the private key associated password to send a transaction out of it make sense basically your amount goes nowhere no one is maintaining your balance your balance is maintained by the blockchain Sudheer I hope I answered your question
no what it does not hold BTC wallet displays what for this coin what you have fine so question from Gayatri Gayatri to answer a question how to transfer from this wallet to my bank account no bank account se bank account all works in terms of Rupees and Dollar
so probably will have to take it to exchange convert into some currency and then move it your bank account this is about Jax their money wallets OK then where can I see the real use of public private key concept using real time to understand it better like account number public and password varies from each Bank
American finereader real time example public private key Bitcoin itself is a real time example otherwise you can find out where ever you do this digital signing digital signatures for example if you I don't know if you are from India OK when you do tax filing ok you would digitally sign a document
so those are based on public private key IC to public address is why problem created to it problem created to accounts Sonalika What always I can change my Fiat money cryptocurrency only way is you should deposit into an exchange And Get It transferred or you meet some person and then no in person and then change
have installed Jacks enabled but unable to see in browser should be someone here ok in the toolbar other every other wise try to reinstall again nothing lap ok ok there's any other
questions so this is all about the wallet ok so what they do you know they've explain how to send receive ok how States for sending Bitcoin steps for receiving it is as simple as that you just go through this Jaxx wallet so where to find Bitcoins so shall I move on any questions are you stuck up let me know
before I start ok so anything I can purchase Bitcoin ok so what else you can there
Bitcoin ATMs not in India but in US you can have seen once in the San Francis San Jose ok so you can find out Bitcoin ATMs in fact there is bitcoin ATM map also can find out OK then you can gift cards you can get it from exchange ok peer-to-peer as you go meet in person and then you can get Bitcoins so these are ways you can purchase Bitcoin how to secure your wallet ok
Saudia secure wallet is she basically have public and private key which have seen right Jaxx wallet see what happens if you copy paste and store it in a Notepad ok someone hacks your computer will be able to get it so the suggestion is even if you have it in notepad something encrypted and keep it and maximum ticket offline so used as a paper wallet as you say multisig wallet hardware wallet so that your funds are safe especially if you are in anything you
think that is so you know more worthy you're not definitely it's good that you moved to someone else Ok so getting your Bitcoins ok getting your Bitcoins so I just want to show you something so I don't know how many of you know how many of you are from India so so where to buy Bitcoins here you can find out like in oz pain in hip in India
bitstamp coins these are some of the places where you can buy that developed on my myself and friend ok so we have developed a website where you can find out where to buy Bitcoin in India so its the website is named tracker.in ok so it will tell you like you know where all you can purchase what all kinds you can purchase in India so it is actually we are officially launching it tomorrow with an Android app I thought I will win
how we can start looking from tomorrow so it will tell you like in where all you can buy cryptocurrencies in India this so this will also have a Android app and share this link with you if you want to just start from tomorrow thank you sir
so Best payment methods ok so whatever we can buy Bitcoins ok so credit card now I think USA stop using credit cards in India I don't think so I can use credit card so some countries they accept credit cards to buy Bitcoins to bank transfer common way Paypal cash cash
aur mining so these are always we can acquire Bitcoin ok next is characteristics that qualify a good Bitcoin exchange so the in fact If you ask me there is no still there are qualifications but still you know its good if you if you purchase after purchase it's better to move it cold ok outside ok not to have it in exchange but if you want to choose a good exchange just find out that
no that exchanges reported that is so it has good founders day apply security patches all those just find out if it's because it is at many places what happens is they lose the Bitcoin ok so exchanges if they don't apply proper security measures I could get easily hacked and union the disclaimer It stays that you know in unprecedented the times they could one can lose Bitcoin so it is better that you move it out
ok selling Bitcoins so you know I can sell it in person or you can sell it online so he questions guys selling Bitcoins so these are basic stuff like where you can buy so selling Bitcoin to a person you should make sure that that person is trustworthy
solve this details you are waiting for your questions
ok so general topics I think all are good they are these are all general topics OK where places to spend Bitcoin ok so so once I've tried is overstock.com here that you can I don't know whether they were removed previously given in Microsoft store at Bitcoin payments now they have removed it because of the transaction fee and
