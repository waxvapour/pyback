able to give me love sorry everything my screen so can I get a Quick yes or no my voice is good just leave it
eating first latest ago the questions so whatever we have seen last week right so any questions and you know if you want to talk directly let me know that is also fine I can meet you I will do that
can you say that say when you say create that's basically creating an instance of a contract right is so and you said that they were storage and there was a memory storage is basically a permanent on the blockchain where is memory in the temporary location on the on in the blockchain it so what are you wanted to understand is like my understanding of blockchain is that there is only one process to install
which is the elite TV that contains all the blocks correct to where is this actual instance of this contractor getting stored at the instance of the contract also goes inside a block ok so then source of the continent is also inside the block right when you say instance you basically means that whatever the second instance is created and that is stored on to the block right
so far is does that also participate in the harsh computation yes ok when you say has competition I believed it is again in a transaction like any other day how you send Bitcoin from one person to another person right said it's the same in all for the blockchain system ok so what only there is some identification ok that knows that this is a contract OK what it
doin what you cannot locate a block has multiple transactions of that so basically what I am trying to understand is that the contract is executed only when a transaction occurs is that correct statement to make can you come come again a contract is executed only when a transaction is made is that a correct statement or not what happens is when you click on that create button ok
so what happens is a contract ok whatever code your great and rights of the contract gets deployed in blockchain ok when I said deployment ok for ok we say that it is deployed in blockchain but for the blockchain what it is ok if you will get blockchain standpoint it is just another transaction so they even the deployment of contract is a transaction is what you trying to say yes ok is but
show the transaction charges between two finger to wall and private keys I would say now in this particular you when I am executing a transgenic securing a contract what what are the 2 participants Vellore to private keys at a participating is it one of the contracts private key and one of the confusion sorry to hear the parties are right one party is
applying the contract ok and where is deploying the contract that is the from 12 so from being suppose you are trying to create a contact you be the from ok and to is your blockchain ok you are sending a transaction to blockchain the private key of administrator kind of thing on the blockchain the one that actually generates a new coins in case of Bitcoin let me show you something here ok all of your rights of yours
what is happening is it's a simple contract which has nothing inside severe clicking on create button ok so what we get is we get something called and contract address okay you click on this you can copy the address of the contract UK Top of it if you see this details ok let me click on this detail you can see that this is nothing but you know what happens is from 0xc A3 ok
that is for now movies you are trying to create this contract ok you became you become the transaction owner from ok now this transaction will happen only when it is signed with your private key ok so those all things are not brought in here ok this is just for testing tool in how to write a smart contract so they are not built in like you know you have to enter your password to passphrase to send as a transaction that is not
so you might get confused so you look at here from this from this is a constructor so where this is nothing but a transaction ok so this solidity file the sol is not stored anywhere at all no no no its not stored the only thing I destroyed is a instance of the contract yes what happens if you remember when you compile your account
but ok you get 2 things you get API you get a bytecode ok this bytecode will be your underline blockchain system can understand what this by codes ok so from so all that is stored in your blockchain is the bytecode this not the solitary file access is this is what is confusing me my understanding of a blockchain is that it consists of transactions which are 11 block consists of multiple
success great white when you say something is stored on blockchain the only information that I am aware of on the blockchain is transaction right now the bytecode is the bytecode Stored against a transaction within the blockchain just let me show you something ok so this is sample contract ok so all of you right so this is sample that's all we have some lines of code there
you are there is machine machine by animation MC Nokia 3 notes so these notes ok whatever be the transaction if you take Bitcoin if its talk about 3 I'm only if you want to send some other to another person all that this machine needs is what transaction happened before that is it needs a block details period period has it needs a block in fact
it's a block contains transactions hash is transaction has that is in-depth ok let's not get into hash level it has transaction 1 transaction 21 so it is also it is unconfirmed transactions confirmed ok ok to the part of a block already its for the blockchain so this ok so what I try here also this Block 1 propagated
you also the Ruby block which gets propagated ok it soon now what you are trying to do work every time the sample dots all sample that's all what will happen is when you come pilot after compilation it will give you something called bytecode OK I will bite code as 16 some zeros and ones okay some type of God this is the bytecode now
if you want to make a transaction ok if you want to send some funds from A to B ok so no he is trying to send to either but not to send one between NBA NBA my notes let's take a lipstick that MB or your notes Ok she is my note right but no you don't transaction between their self there are two different private keys with distance between this
ok so when is inode ok let's say that this node has wallet one ok ok ok you are created wallet one ok and we have your public and private key and from Navodaya ok you have again you have a wallet wallet ok ok ok so from is wallet you are trying to send to either to this wallet one OK then what happens if you have the entire list
transaction every node has the entire transaction list or blocklist yes so basic validation would be done and your transaction would get propagated node to node ok everything will validate then the mining process will happen ok the way I'm sorry if I am tall when you did the very first step simple dots all anyone compiled it
the bytecode must be stored somewhere at the receiver I am trying to do was first I want to prove that so whatever happens with your transaction right same thing is happening with the sample dots also I am not there yet ok if you send it is ok now let's take two things understanding either if you understand sending it then deploying contraction
it is the same concept engineering and all the actions that your performing I generally is being considered as a transaction on the blockchain that's right ya and it will get propagated to all the notes because it becomes the part of the transactions in definitely gets complicated lol that's right so basically this is there is a possibility that simple dots all gets compiled and stored on a transaction T1 inside
block B1 and then and which is which is its own transaction by itself and then in future when you are trying to execute the transaction should be bound to this so now now this is why the second questions so I got the part that this is a transaction now when I say create button action and fighting against an address
that address is basically the address of the transaction on which has got it got compile is that correct this transaction it has bytecode one and now the steps called deploy ok you have something called deploy once you do this also transaction only thing only additional feature it has got is ok so normal transaction means when you say
Sunita adjust returns your transaction hash ok but only if you deploy a contract you get additional your contract address ok so there is a special method would be using to send a transaction so this will in turn it will give you know what is your country sample that's all what is that address so supposed the address is 05 something like this so this address it would return ok
when you when you differentiate between both of it normal transaction and what happens when you deploy a smart contract only difference is both are transactions but this is enough contract deployment so you can deposit it into deployment or compile and applied to different steps I can compile and deploy is two different steps but we're just doing compile and create this is a told this remix to drive OK what I do
both of them both of them for you here also you see Two Steps we compile it start complaining ok and creates all the relevant API and details now when you hit create this is when it goes to block you ok so because it is special in a you get a contractor ok now whenever I want to invoke it then I would first call week
now I have an address and I have that method so so how does now let's save in block B1 this contract got compiled and you know and God created I have an address with me and I want to invoke it now but that happened in like now at present the blockchain is at block five v5 this was at B1 right now I want to execute this
contractor that's even have an address would I have to go back to figure out the bytecode opposite being stored separately its Like Mike vs OK so the next question this we are into something called state variable ok so if you remember we are seen it but it makes me so there is something called level DB write it so this apart from your
blockchain there are two models Pune security Expo model on discount based model ok so in in Italian word it is all level TB what happens if you have a blockchain and apart from that you have a level DB this is for a easy lookup ok to be very difficult to iterate through the entire blockchain ok so you have something called level DP so in this level DP what will happen is so the most important things right so
for example this is your contractor dress 0 1 CBD so this will be stored as in a lookup value so if and suppose you have some get methods example ok you have it here so instead of going travelling to the block it will it this is like a key value pair database ok it will find out of here and again this level DB also will be synced between
ration when you put your not this level TP get rich and with the same contract address here right now if I want to perform if I want to like when I when the uses her transacting so do private key is sending therium to each other at that time how would I specify that this particular contract has to be executed or every time all the contacts are getting executed is it like that
and then it goes inside in matches of the wallet Matches and do this kind of thing because this suppose I create like you know if you see here there is three contracts have created a sample you have be your hero DC 57 ok and what I am doing suppose if I want to interact with this contract this instance I clicked this get rid so I should know as user ok I should
like what contract address I'll have to interact with so that is only identity of got time so I'm too right where you can I go online and you know copy paste your transaction and get executed so I mean in case of Bitcoin in case of any kind of what I am talking about it like in case of ethereum so you will always have to specify the address of the
contract that you want to execute when that when I know this is also considered as a transaction so I can you most of you would be knowing about ICSE right let's look at some ICU recent ICU famous IRC 20 compatible
I'm just trying to find out your recent I see ok me a minute if there is something called across you this is take Road right so what I'm going to do Steak rod I see you ok
show me go to there is not found any need to go to the ICU page give me a minute
ok so here if you look at here this is it over time if suppose if I want to invest on this ratio ok and where is my address
fill in the order form give a minute guess just take another ICU multivan
ok so this is so no one I see you called multi when I see you something that ok now if I want to buy this I click on it does not update its ok shortly
some where you can find out like if you want to buy I see you ok you need to send funds to sum contract right that's what I eat other contractor dress not that it's ok for example of popular TalkBack token in one of the popular contractors
so what I am going to do it will go find out the contractor dress so here is the contract source code ok this location I clicked on it and I live in yes ok so this is my smart contract code ok so what happened this is all constructed
AVM code and then it got deployed ok after deployment in a something we received something called 06309 this is nothing but the contract address ok so jao happening on ethereum blockchain itself yes so all these tokens are getting issued on ATM blockchain all AC 20 tokens only RC Sony to cancel getting issue on blockchain
and they are getting issued because of this contact address that you have yeah so suppose if you will have to send only if you want to participate in ICU you'll have to send funds only to this contractor and it'll and once you send funds you should see if you go down in the contract so screwed solidity you should see some place that is too whatever Which ever address has send the money to a delicious issue that I can do that
yes ya cycle Italy Corporation launch my own coin exactly can do it so that is why I gave this example is because so the question was ok there was level TB how do I give an example I how do you call that get method ok or when I showed this example so there were three get methods ok this is fine
but really how it works so really how would work this many are creating tokens but suppose if you want to part participate in the bat ICU what we should do you should know your address correctly in the ancient know that address contact address right only then you would be able to send funds to it and get the bat tokens for it ok so for that matter anything if your contract say something like a smart car contract you have to know that you know what is the address I'll have to send me or
interact with the identity of a smart why is the creator with you that is the publisher at particular transaction that is a transaction hash contact created just below the address watch and one another
tractors Nokia thinking chapter 45 ok 5 ok to think Sony Six Channel owned account and another one is a contract address so this this has to come from some contract owner ok so this phone is this person and he must have spend the gas to actually get the contact via deployed that's right after that everybody you will just keep on giving sending the money to this contact address just keep on getting Bhatt
tokens exactly as of now I think I do understand little bit of it and help you have lot of more questions thanks again for being patient man unless I a not a problem thank you sir thank you
for some reason I'm not able to see your question window can someone ping me hi again or something like that yeah yeah it okay question console.log is not working so silent there is no console
clock in solidity world ok so can we run 1 program having import file name yet so don't let her spend time on it so it is doable not a problem I will show you sometime you know quickly can show you that can be used one contact using vs code and deploy what is the use of value Vs code and all rights over its all the blockchain whatever we exploding right now we create in this class you're going to create a private chain
ok and to do this BS code and other things will take a long time ok so will be going out of topic when time permits I will quickly show you how to do it ok so now all of you right so what you can do is many a times you won't be able to copy paste content so for that what you'll have to do is in your course content under 60 module you can find something called
pickle file practical file folder ok so click on it and download this file and keep it ready in hand so that what happen is if you want to copy something it will be easier to copy your eyes and from the PPT you won't be able to do it make sense and the presentation so please have this ready and now let's go to others
questions today looks like in a very less participants only 13 punishments today Anand Jason rupees Sandeep all good Subhash Sudhir Villas
ok good here so what we have seen last week guess all of you believe in all of you have started your VM ok so what I would do was like instead of showing my machine problem I will remote into someones machine ok and let you do it is over in my machine something would have installed I don't want to show that
some any volunteers you know you are only going to do it so don't feel that will be missed out you know you are going to do it I will be getting ok make sense or I can also do it how are you know you want ok so I'm fine so let me only today
ok now par last class right we have selected this remix and we have selected this unsafe scripts all the stuff right till here we have seen and we were able to create some time transaction so this is what we have seen last week right so any questions on this have seen till here actually
ok so any others anybody questions ok sorry give me a minute let me open my VM so why we did
last last week if you look at last we ok so what we have done is normally there in a we use using VM read so the environment would be JavaScript VM this is what we used in the last weeks class what we did this be used with three provider ok so I really just when we use JavaScript VM what happens is it is giving your test environment to test in a test to simply easily
I couldn't tested ok but real time if you go to production environment or if you want to deploy something on a public chain so you this doesn't help right so what we do if we click on the something called PS3 provider ok and right now and we connected to something called testrpc so that is also blockchain simulator but you can extend this to connect to a public blockchain itself was if you want this to be connected to public blockchain and then
play the contract that is possible so that's why we have this interface this is just nothing but interfacing component this with 3 provider make sense will look at injected with three soon ok ok so next next we are going to look at
metamask ok so all of you right can you follow this document let me open the document
document and latest set metamask no need to know whether the given metamask here here we have
metamask right so lets install this metamask and see like you know what is it used for here or there were just given about tomato mask and account I will tell you when I will just added more why we need this metamask ok so if you write open your Chrome browser
can the in Chrome browser type in metamask Chrome extension or metamask type Chrome is DNS server could not be found
wait minute new memories with me set up this internet ok fine now
Mohit let me in a just hold not monthly phone can just hold on for a sec let me know show this app and then you look at your machine ok now let's what I'm going to do was so already I have a metamask let me remove this remove from Chrome so metamask Chrome extension type
enter you shouldve know for some reason I have this internet issue but I hope you should not be having it give me a minute
it's all working
team can you hear me and see my screen hello ok ok fine guess I had some issues with this go webinar ok had to re install whole thing again and do it in on so that's why I took some time you don't worry about the last
give a second your fine Anand
I know that it's it will be getting late anyway we watched for two additional classes in a one or two additional classes ok so should be a problem you will see some in Google Chrome what I'm going to do this metamask I have this internet
again and again I don't know why she probably like Mohit oil use your machine
what can you can you share your screen hello Sunil can you hear me
can you share your screen I was actually I am so Shailendra I saw you question give me a minute or two will be there ok I'll show you why you are not able to see the doors accounts there
his name so I can you meet me there is not on
you get any invite ok fine yeah so can we go to the Ubuntu machine so how was all of your able to see its machine right
ok so now what we will do is all of you write him a second so first in the Google Chrome already there is a metamask installed ok so if you look at your address bar at the end of the drums address bar we can look there is a fox I can you are right click on it and remove it completely first right click on it remove from Chrome
ok good click on remove ok so now its not there ok so what we are going to do was click a new tab and type in metamask space Chrome presenter ok so now its taking you to Web Store Chrome store
Suno click on it and then you should get an add button SOA click on add to Chrome ok fine so now you see that you all of you in a you can see a foxicon OK so
are we good tell here had any difficulties installing it let me know so the next steps I hope all of your followers on the next step is click on it ok click on except ok scroll down and click on accept
ok now here type in some password probably typing it yureka and yureka confirm it and click on create it is not think it should be of length size eat something like you know which is 8 characters you can create your account ok fine
so now all of you right so once you give your password and you confirm your password it will give you this seed word ok so most of the wallets the wallet recharge show new Exodus and some wallets all of them uses this encryption keys this seed words with clsid words actually ok save this ok save this
somewhere so that why it is required suppose if you want to recover this then you need it ok so click on record it and copied it somewhere ok so now what happens is it takes you to metamask account ok so ok all of you tell here are you able to see
ok so no worries if you don't save it you can create a new one so do not worry ok but ideal if you are looking at a production wallet or another real wallet then it is good that you take a copy of it ok fine so now Mohit so are we all good till here any questions I hope all of you have done till here ok
now click on so have a DNS issue on Chrome in VM doing that right from can you will do it later ok that one so now click on that metamask so now what we're going to do was inside of in at the top right you can see that there is main network it so instead selected
click on inner there are different networks which are available ok so for a moment what I can do it can you give me screen access can you identify have access you provide me access ok fine I'll let you know what this metamask is for
OK then it'll make a real sense ok so let me create a new file ok so what happens just in a blockchain we all know that there is no day ok so there is not b c and d sofa and also know that a lot of notes in the network available but in the real
right so I am a user ok so I don't know I don't care about storing all the entire blocks into my blockchain ok it's very difficult for every user to ask him to store the blockchain correct in that case what will happen is people go for a light client wallet ok so what is that light client wallet we will see so metamask you say like client wallet meaning meaning what happens here is better
mask will hold all the blockchain for you ok so metamask will have all the blocks whatever then he will sync it till the latest one all the inner B1 B2 and let's tell that you know we will block 1 million something all the block searching now there is a user ok who doesn't care about it you know it let's say that it's fun Khan ok all he wants to do
you know he want to do is transferred some eaters or something like that and we don't want to store the entire blockchain in this machine I don't want to get into that be ok so what you can do is he can install this metamask ok and with this some kind of this private stuff right this this Edwards ok so that is what is taking taking care of the security he should be able to still send eaters
we will I will show you simulation UK so can you go to so I go to Chrome OK what I do here is I click on metamask all of you please follow me so in the top right I see main network in giraffe main network I select dropdown I select robsten text network ok make sense all of you got it
so now all of you what I want you to do is so there is address here ok Sweet account there is a address here ok so probably more with you can click on copy address to clipboard ok done Rakesh you ask like what it is in a menu like in what do you mean by that
the address or just give me a sec let us address robsten ok so robsten is nothing but so there are different networks if the rain is working on one is a public change what we see we went to eat ask and auto and all that we have seen is nothing but the public chain so that is the real ethers ok but for test environment test also they have deployed there on this blog see if you want to connect to
you know if theory I'm stressed network so that is called robsten likewise they have like 4 or 5 different networks you can test with ok so those are these networks okay make sense no do we need to change and run we are not there yet Shailendra ok so all I want you to do is now click on this robsten select this we are and roxton ok click on this three dots and copy the address to clipboard
click on it if you are copied OK so the next step out I want you to show us open a new tab ok after copying open a new tab ok here all of you typing or rocks 10
aur Mohit decantation robsten aaropi stn space faucet ya hit enter ok and click on the first one Italian robsten faucet oh ok guys are we
here ok so if you are not able to follow let me know I know phone can have some difficulty but others are we good to hear ok so now what you do is copy paste the address right so what what it is I'll tell you this past it is nothing
it is automated tool which will send you sample eaters but this either does not have any value it is this is just a test net either ok so select this and click on send me another copy paste the address what you have given ok and then click on it ok once you click on it what happens is a transaction has a transaction got initiated
ok fine now click on your metamask window metamask you click on that ok so if you wait for a while you can see that right now the Ether zero eaters right you can see that there is no it's ok after a while you can find out that there is some other balance ok let's in it it'll take a while ok so for
that where is our transaction OK what we can do it in the below you can see that you know you can click on your account number problem what you can do this again can you click on send me one either Mohit so then it created the request was accepted fine ok now you should get a transaction hash below previously
transaction hash below I don't see it now so that if you have received the ETA let me know so can you click on metamask again ok now you see that there is one either correct so all of you right you should be able to see some others in your account ok I know the idea of it
why I want to show you this is because you have not connected to this robsten blockchain you have not downloaded all the blocks of this blockchain but still you are able to receive one either right without having the blockchain this is nothing but the light client ok as a user all he is worried about is the transaction send to and he should have his private key safely ok but blockchain someone is maintained for
you know without this right so if you just imagine you have a mobile ok it should be RCC that you know in your mobile you need to transact right in your mobile if you need to download the entire block which has 20 gig so broken will be a big failure right so that's where this light client was going to help us make sense so all of you are able to see this one either
ok Rupesh says I get my request were rejected and it will take some time Sandeep Rupesh it will take some time ok so when it is rejected right there could be several reasons you guys seen that Rupesh your request was rejected suppose if your address is not exactly limit okay suppose there was some copy paste issue that could be a problem can you try copying it again
then in a paste it and then send me a either ok Sandeep from where to copy the address to send either OK where to copy is here when you open this metamask I can first you'll have to select robsten ok after selecting it there is three dots right click on it on clicking the third option copy address to clipboard from here is very love to copy it
the address make sense case Sandeep can you try doubt Rupesh what is happening with you now
ok fine ok after doing this I will show you one more thing and we are done with metamask ok ok so Sandeep got it and Rupesh is trying ok good
so is metamask a commonly used tool to do this metamask you are one of the popular ones okay so metamask is operated by something called shape shift ok so even if you look at Exodus wallet so that as a tie up with the shape shift ok now I am going to show you something now right you don't drop down that network
in that select click on that and select localhost 8545 Yukon it ok so now what you see is there is zero balance I think this what Shailendra was mentioning ok now can you all right I know that you are selected private network and you don't see anything that is fine completely fine ok not a problem now all of you what I want you to do is go to the
terminal window and start tester PC that shall open the terminal window ok hear ya can you close it and restart again
sometimes Ok dot / yeah ok so now what I want you to do where is this ok so all of you could see that that is when you type and dot / tester PC that sell you can find a list of accounts and
private key can you copy the first private key in a scroll up and copy the first two private key I hope all of you have copied the first private key so now I know let's not paste it ok no no no no no no no give me a minute ok no Export Private key just give me a second ok now click on this
is a rotating there is a there is a circle like I cannot click and click on that ok click on import account ok now your paste your private key which we have copied there you can import
ok we are there can you I don't know how you got a complex now there is account to write so in account to have got one either ok others have you tried it
not getting system can you do one thing give me a minute not do not worry will finish the sun only move on to next one so don't worry about it if you don't get it
first time that's why not about all problem ok ok so let me take your machine ok as a remote and I have access right so what I am going to do this is
Limited
you need to start again no no no without dots last what I am going to do was testrpc just tester PC and I am going to prasanta ok guys what I am trying to do here is ok so by default your sister PC comes with couple of things ok it comes with this you know available accounts and you get private key
right so what I am going to do I am going to copy some movies can you copy some private key copy it import account click on import now you can see account through which are 100 others have $4,000 hostel
hahaha this $40,000 rate today it's more than $40,000 rate I sent can you repeat what you said on the steps for the private network yeah I will do that ok so when you click on his metamask OK what is happening as you know there is a option you in the dropdown you can select different networks you know what I want you to do you select localhost 8545 ok
after doing this now go on to the terminal window whatever last week we used right this testrpc that still ok start that and copy the private key and then paste it here ok ok so yeah sometimes you might have an ETA to either that's fine ok so that is how it is configured
let me know if you are if you are good tell here then I will show you something else with these are not in the believe it's not there in the PDF I just want to show you like you know how this web client works so that with you be used ok good Jason is there now how about Anand and others Anand Rupesh all good Villas
a good good Jason fine ok Sandeep OK so the next step is what I want you to do I hope you know I'm not getting any questions so this should I be running anything
console to started postpaid 4558 545 will have to start that tester PC that shall Sudhir that should be it still it is showing connecting to unknown private network
ok now what I'll do is I'll take Rakesh machine Rakesh is it good day free ticket machine remote Rakesh are Sudheer you know I think both of your having the same problem same issue with Sandeep to ok so I need one of your machines Sudheer okay Mohit I'm good text to this machine enough for some time
let me look at your machine only then I'll come to know Sandeep I hope you all of you are having the same problem let's find out Sudhir you have to share your screen ok
so where are we now ok a click on that metamask I can but I'm asking you ok now it is connected to ok it says connect
unknown private network that's ok can you go to the terminal window in The Terminal 1 new window can I scroll up Kanika centre on ok can you can you come out of it Press control C come out of it
now open your metamask ok try selecting a different network selected option something is it ok now in select from the dropdown select customer PC not customer PC select local
localhost said OK not a problem you again start tester PC start tester PC leave this matter must Windows start Picture PC and come here ok you can do
ok just opposite without dresses right that's ok ok without that SH is also fine type in present ok so now again can you click on this metamask I can know ok so best thing what we will
who is right click on add remove under can you re install right click on it remove from Chrome remove ok now go to that metamask Chrome extension add to Chrome again
ok now click on it you can they can Ok so now except give some password scroll down except you
Titan some password account create ok but that's ok you say that I've copied it somewhere that's why it's not copy it not a problem ok now select instead of my network select a CrPC and see localhost 845 and see again if it happens
let's just wait for couple of minutes and see what's going on now doesn't matter Shailendra it's trying to connect to the sport that is what is happening
Kisi kills all the government is it again that might work maybe Disney could be that looks like you know something related to put some processes making it so what will do is ok let's not spend time on it so now the processes orators open not open right
does not opened it ok so this is the process for some reason there is some issue okay probly you could connect not connected now ok good good ok fine so this is what right so now you can copy a private key and paste it here and see what happen what is happening so other side Sandeep so this is a process in Iraq and Science just copy it
no no its not fully copied make sure that it is fully copied other it's not going to work yeah pasted import
yeah see I think you are there it was not copied properly metamask
ok so u c hundred acres right here right tried to follow the same procedure ok so one more thing I want to show you probly I can show from your machine only can you go to the sister PC Window here you can find something called mnemonic Ride It Says concert tunnel everything can you copy all of it will produce
from here here no no no from concert to produce u c h t wallet in August what happens is when you type in not with Pista PC do not sell but just tester PC you get this mnemonic ok you copy it she have copied it right so now click on this metamask I can again ok now what I want you to do it
click on that come in around I can make a customer care of some kind of can you click on it now can you click on that three dashes you can't log out ok click on restore from seed phrase ok type in your in the whatever your copyright can you copy paste
that yeah now type in your password click on ok ok now you select you know click on this 3 days is ok or there
American see many accounts click on that again view account ok fine so let's not get get too much into it so the idea is right so the ideas you can see how we have copy pasted one private key and see in one account like ways you can list out all this account screw this mnemonic code
ok so if you start 12 word C word sheet word you can list on all your account OK so the idea the entire idea why we're going through all this is to understand that ok see if customer wants to have a life. Ok he doesn't want to maintain the blockchain but he still wants to interact and Eenadu all the transactions it is allowed ok so that is the main objective of this simple demo water
practicals were gone through is it fine I'm sorry sorry I missed you there I would really be ready to go to Aashiqui type in the morning and Sumona great Sunday morning let's not get into it so that's what I said OK maybe you know if it start troubleshooting that it will take time in a problem to that is an exercise should ideas be copied one private key and you got one account right so if you want to import all the accounts you have this mnemonic code with that you can import ok but let's not get into it
it's not that important ok make sense hello yeah yeah thank you Jason you say that you mention like others mentioning that they don't find mnemonic code ok so if you type that / disturb PC that sell you don't you won't find mnemonic code ok so only when you type in testrpc just simple testrpc only
confined mnemonic code ok so Sandeep I hope you are also fine now like Sandeep Rupesh all know who has difficulty try rings enough just read reinstall this metamask Roman drive ok so 9:20 now so what will do it will take 5 minute break OK then once we are back
we will look at how to setup a private ethereum network ok so that a lot of things will have to see you will look at that ok so probly you know we'll take a break Sandeep do you want to stay in or do you want to show your screen Sandeep is having some difficulty but I think Sandeep you said that you can't share your screen right for some reason I can you
you can ok give me a minute so this will have a break ok probably will have a 10 minute break this sorry about that ok so that we can get it fixed
give me a minute
Sandeep can you share your screen I sent your request
Sandeep can you share your screen I am not able to see your screen Sandeep probly you should have received an invite to share the screen
no I don't know I don't hear you said it let me shower again I need your presenter hello
Sandeep Trident share screen hello did you try installing it so can you go to your command window terminal window
ok ok can you started testrpc and presenter no copy paste a private key
ok ok ok now go to metamask and open it because it metamask
ok now select some other network for some different network on roxton ok now get selected click on localhost 8545 let's give some time but see what happens
nothing to come up
ok let's do one thing can you right click remove an again added can you try again install
Sandeep can you click on Chrome web store second one the second one from here
click on add to Chrome you click on that I can
scroll down except except some password to me during count to 3 something
copied it somewhere safe click on have copied somewhere safe go to
localhost 845 localhost 8545 localhost for fair customer from from the drop down again can you select local horse 8445
OK it is 8545 for some reason its not connecting ok send it will see later ok so we'll officer wedding Right Here Waiting so probly that should be some something which is not allowing probly we can try out in Firefox another browser ok but this is a procedure okay
find probly or end of the class if you are free we can look at it once again showcase yeah so we'll move on to the next topic ok Sandeep party on Sunday we will look at after sometime ok at the end of the class will look at it but this is the procedure
ok is that ok Jason when I import another key is created another account account so I did not create another account inserted imported your account from tester PC ok so that is what is happening
now again making more Thatha prasanta and we'll walk through the private change setup ok can you share your screen and I probly and meet you also
ok so now the next half of the class what we are going to see if we are going to look at we are going to look at how to setup a private chain using ethereum you can we are going to use get as a client ok in the couple of classes before I mention that a lot of clients like there is a client call parity there is a client called get there is something called it cause a lot of platforms are there
we are going to look at it as a client ok so now can you so all of you right so all of you can you go to the course module and download the PDF which I mentioned go to the course curriculum and inside course curriculum there will be a practical file can you open that all of you ok so in fact we are going to follow all the
steps ok so jao what I would do it then and then I am going to stop you can explain like you know what we are why we are doing this know what is that which is happening so you can also in a run the steps and you can create a private chain not a big deal at all I will stop in between and let you know that why we are doing it and full can I think you also had some issues related to DNS for setting up the private chain in others not be any problem ok so you can go ahead and do that
with respect to DNS I think it's better that you get in touch with edureka support P ok if there is something wrong they should be able to figure it out ok fine so all of you right now now you can close for now you can close this terminal Window all this testrpc whatever we have done right so you can close all the stuff
and the first thing you can use call to Mohit setting a private season 11 can you scroll the Pdf all terminal and all tab means if you have anything module 6 PDF that's right module 6 it'll be called as practical file
so
restart the blocks, no no no no so we have done all the steps ok so scroll down still not will find something called setting up a private chain in the PDF scroll down further
private blockchain developing private blockchain so this is what we're going to do ok so let me take you can you give me access let me quickly explain like what it is for you haven't you have access ok so love you I hope all of you are following me ok let me
youth in my machine only and then give you back the access this is everyone able to see my screen are we good can I get a Quick yes or no
ok good fine so now what is that you'll do ok give me a quick minute so what we will do was first as a first step right we will download this aquarium
postcode ok from get up first chappals insulation part so what is that we're trying to enslave install ok we are trying to install GIT client ok so get this nothing but go ethereum developed by Go With It is developed by the ethereum community itself ok it's their own client software what comes along with it is it is coupled with get and it even
ok underlying architecture we have seen that it is a VM and top of it there is a client right so this get when we download it has both ok we have this idiom and opposite we have this get this is what we will download after downloading what we will do if we will be setting up private network what is private network so right now what we have seen his be used something called remix and created some smart contract so what that is it is only for
development purpose for quick testing purpose we are using that ok then we look that metamask as a client perspective that is also fine but real world real world in your enterprise environment if you want to do something you will have to set up a private chain so that private change we are using ethereum Ok the gift we are downloading and we are going to setup that private chain so that is what we will do and after setting up private chain we will do money ok so Mining in AP
network ok so we will create accounts will set up a private network will create accounts ok and will start some mining procedure and I will introduce to some of the commands to some GIT commands UK both GIT commands and with 3 comments OK what is web 3 I'll tell you in near there with the commands these are in this is what we are going to see in the car
turn on the next honoured office any questions okay Sofia as and when we go in a we look at the steps will be getting questions will look at them ok I'll make again make a motor centre of you I hope you open the PDF document ok in the PDF document
ok you started executive stuff ok ok no problem ok can you so what you'll have to do you already clone right so probably can you maximize it
it is better but ok so I guess go to the PDF document and first do a grown go to the PDF document just show that command alone so we'll have to execute this command ok from the PDF so what basically what we are doing is nothing but we are like clone
the get software I mean not get software get software ok well I know you've already done right but it's ok then you can fire
is the ATM ko implemented in go language that's right to even the ETV am in case of this code base is still in the go yeah he was written and go and weekend
multiple instance of this go with you I'm in one VM so it will become multiple nodes know we can do that only thing is so good question we can do that only thing is will have to take care of the port number different different port number CSE project on different port numbers then how is the broadcast going to work it is suggested
it's just for the afternoon only you will configure Rush 2 notes on your machine you configure Race 2 notes ok so now all of you can you simply type go and press enter just want to make sure that you have a golang installed version whatever it
no its cute sometime not let sweatshirt and let's go be the document ok so what will happen if someone ok so next Two Steps From the document is give me a minute ok let's follow the document only ok so next what we should do is if all of you have done with this then probably go to the go
MCD going to go to contacts and others right so I know I know that I speak with Mohit since he's a present so but others if you also have no one to have a chat while we in a while we do this activity I can meet you let me know who are wants to get unmuted I can do that ok so for now follow the document
so now we what we have done as we have downloaded from in a GIT repository we have downloaded all the theorems stuff right ok so the next step what is the next step dad tried and tried to follow it till this GIT branch tried to follow till GIT branching
Amrit so we basically have to check out version 1.6.7 that's right now should I present yeah you can good
choti moral able to follow can I get it quicker so no need to download in home directory that's right ya still processing OK go ahead till GIT checkout guys if you have done till GIT checkout
ok so since we don't have golang installed I am going to send you in a link where you can follow install golang ok give me a minute ok let's all follow the same document so if the
some issue right so I can help you should I go and install golang in my machine I don't have good and yeah give me one sec ok I am just trying to find out some
left
give me a minute guess so I think it is there in the presentation but not in the not in the PDF file Let me find out real quick in a sec
yeah there is golang installation so it is there in the document actually ok let me send you some real quick step how much can you type in w get I hope it works right click on w get attribute I can't get it works right yeah I'll send you
patora think is Ubuntu I should be able to do Sudo apt-get install and I should be able to meet try the specific version 1 and its not
now and package name is different one minute so let's go w get do it I can explain give it ok give me a minute guys let me quickly get you the steps I think by default on getting version 1.6 but if I add a new BP high then I can get version 1.8
I am just trying to send some common comment so everybody can you follow that 1 sec so that is it is there in the PDF document but let me make your life easy ok give me a minute wait but ill go check out right I hope all of you have completed or trying to do that
call m.org will use 1.8 forever
class you are going to use 1.8.3 Linux I fun 386 in a minute after getting adding the PP I am able to get 1.8 that I can give 3 commands that can actually
toilet seat on the Indian funny is it getting installed after installing right can you give me you know just check type in go and make sure that is installed and then have to added to the path so I have to equip 802 ok but we need only 1.8 and also we need question X3
ok so that'll take care right all Nautanki to take care that shit is it should be 20 for adding to the path is what I think ok Jason till dental check out Shailendra already there about others
Shri Subhash Rupesh confirm Anand Gayatri Rakesh can I get a Quick yes or no yes ok
problems rights right now we need this go language golang install so that we can further proceed ok so I am just creating some commands so that we can easily download go and install office can follow the same steps so it would be easier ok so that's why he got version 1.8.7 is auto close to you want specific version 1.8. And I've got 74 the machine is 64 that's why
64 version ok so most of it may be having a 64 then that's not a problem can you type can you move the sub into have you set the path to go I am going to set
I probably will have to set this in Basha she will do that ok so can you send me those commands should I just replaced it to me I will think I don't know if you can broadcast I will go down protest today I was reset it to you
so guys I am going to send you some list of commands ok so let us run this command one by one so what it is going to do with it is going to install this golang seen your machine ok so let me know once you are done till here ok so let's wait till we do a makin enough
proceed so everyone can see your machine what's going on
Jason make all commands feels ok no we should not let me know if you have installed go ok whatever commands have sent you right to install this commands before going into mein call Sophia install till may call just ping me saying that it's done or if you have any issues let me know
I am not send any file but have send some commands I hope all of you have got those commands redmi let me send again
have you received the commands as I need a yes or no answer otherwise I would I would love him that you have got it
running from home directory ok yeah go hit the after installing after installing
all of you what you have to do is copy the last command it is export path equal to dollar path writes the last command ok can you yeah so what will have to do is type ji edit OK then type in I will send you this command also not be problem ok
so this is once you complete all the steps Ok actually can see a presenter Amit can you presenter and
ok so end of the file so what will happen guys this once you enter this command it open a file so at the end of it just paste this export path the last command export path command should be fine now all of you right save it and close this window and type SOS SOS
space error the same thing by Shazia can you send this command also I think the space that is getting and it seems a space so guys there should not be any space
looks like I'm getting some questions assured function yeah so guys are we all good till here
chapter 2 added do this
still downloading
so how about others I see like enough for Sandeep it's still downloading for Sudhir it still running about others Shailendra also it still running for Jason also still running ok so in the meantime ready if we know since then let me
is there something in a let me explain you give me a minute let me quickly take my screen so what we were trying
Louis vivet downloading get ok so that we can build get and start working start deploying are creating a private change so far that goes a basic thing which is required to do this Run make command we required go so we are trying to download that ok so without these two right we can't proceed so
ok so Shailendra wanted to run program with input file name right so what Twilight right so ideas right he wanted to Shailendra wants to try if I want to do some input how do I do I import suppose you have
text dots on UK is this what your asking a cylinder so I don't know which part it will refer to see I think there is a space and you have to correct the space
Chinmaya Naseeb and export not a valid identifier you might wanna edit your bus I see I can only move the space between just before the /
Sudhir the terror was from installation not that I typed ok yesterday so sorry if you are trying to install after editing the basics best profile it will try to import best profile and that would be there so you might want to fix that first and once you fix that and then try to install by go it would work
Satyajit just give me a sec let me explain what is going on so sorry few is able to see my screen right away let me give me a minute ok so these were the commands absent ok
all of you right so these were the commands this needs to go run one by one ok so tell here are we good have you all installed till the third step or you are facing any errors still Sudo apt install golang 1.8 go Sandeep Sandeep and Sudheer you had some issues right are we good till the third step
96 reaction change the sequence and tried editing the back first and that might be there if you're ok ok so fine you're so if you have not done right so this is the order ok first it has to be this one okay what did does use it you know whatever we're trying to install right so it bills that depositary you get update of it and then you install it so this sequence of steps
just be followed Asus ok and here there is a space sorry about that ok so this is the another without any space will have to set up this part ok so if you have not done this in this order right so I would ask you all to follow the same order ok so after doing this what we
going to do this mean after this only we will add Sudo ji edit or not just be added by Shashi OK then in the last line of the file you'll have to copy paste this one okay make sure that should not be any space here so that is very important ok after this step
save save the file come out of it ok after this you will have to type in source followed by this one so Sudhir so first I need to run a date and then no no no no ok first you know no harm
in doing that but just start with this first one this is the first one the second one day goes on like this so others I know that you know Sudhir is facing some issue but how about others are we all good till here till source by Shashi can I get a Quick yes or no
suggestion is good till here Shailendra is good till here Rupesh Shri Anand Farhan Rakesh can I get a Quick Kaise no Subhash Sandeep Sudheer
today so I can proceed so can I get a Quick cash on you guys otherwise I assume that you will install till here I am recording based on the odd redoing based on the order is specified ok
Sandeep about you other than Sudhir I hope all of you have installed
latest explain it selects Q another 2 minutes then we will move on to the next one its making
Teri Mudra steps guys I need to get a son otherwise I would not be knowing like where you are ok ok
but why 1.6 we have selected 1.8 right here did you tried to follow different command same on
should not be a problem we'll take a look Sudhir where does that go I know ok this one this one should go to this path ok so you should click on an hour typing ji edit of this Basha scene
and being here at the end of the end of the file go to the end of the file and paste this one and save it and then do this ok so done till it right so all of you now you know in your command when you when you type in go and press
there is not get any errors ok it should say that you know I have installed go can you give it a try yeah can you remove that space no not the entire thing just this one and only reason you're with outer space
ok Sudhir dental export command ok have you done this one also be added till this export command also do this command source this command
so that's ok Shailendra that's fine not a problem ok so now all of you right so what will have to do it we will go to the next steps OK what are the next steps nothing but ok so we are going to go into this go
theriyum folder UK from the home directory will go on to the school period folder and do am a call so that is what we're going to do so this should be successful so let's try and see if it is successful so follow the inner follow this PDF document in the PDF document you can find out that you know you need to go into CD therium
like you know we'll have to go to this folder Siliguri theory I'm being in Goa Dairy I'm try to do my call so can you I'll give it a try and see if its working yeah go ahead Mohit so you see here we are inside going to rename folder being here we are trying to run make call ok so they should run for a while
and I know I should get some success message can you I'll give it a try so it failed for Shailendra how about others
Jason Sudheer its in process ok ok so it's all it's all in which case it's all done
Santosh what's going on
so let us all create a ride in a if it is work if it has worked can you follow the steps ok the steps the next step is creating a Genesis
block ok tell here can we create a Genesis block and creating folders that is I want you to do step number step number to ok in step number 2 also just the first portion let me share my screen real quick give me a minute
Sourav you write what you have to do is this 4 steps so you'll have to create this directory just follow this document ok and just paste this content here till here you complete ok so that is what we let's not do this one you can hear you try to do it in the meantime let me see that if others have any issues
fix that so Jason Sudhir great work make call Shailendra think probably I don't know how come you're 1.6 version can you click on let me typing
ok so can you share your screen so how about others guys are real
Shri Rakesh in Rupees is going to try in offline but others Anand Farhan Lavika ok Rakesh is all good so silent having some issues because he's having 1.6 version ok
I'll take a real quick so we're lets others right just follow the procedure okay till creating this directory and Genesis Jason right so till that you finish ok in the meantime I let me know find out what's going on with Ok Rakesh you have done till that good
Shailendra can you share your screen ok so something might of gone bad can you get your command window on type pin
go to command window here goshen history presenter you see here I have tried Sudo apt install golang ifn go right thing
try to follow the steps again Sudo how to uninstall give me a minute so what you can do this I will send you a command so that you can remove the existing go insulation and then try again with
I have sent you the same order ok so this will uninstall
ok so Shailendra did you get my message yeah so try to uninstall and then follow the same command and try to reinstall again uninstall
shut doesn't work like that give me a second okay instead of an install just give remove pseudo APK fun get remove enter ok so as you keep uninstalling and you know install the new stuff OK so the mean
come back to you know others have you all done it can we move an ok so till now what we have done will just refresh
we have downloaded go before that what we have done as we have install in a downloaded this go ethereum and we have not set up private change it ok so all we have done is we have just downloaded the required installables and we are now ready to setup the private Chef OK so the basic requirement is go another requirement is get software so both of it we have downloaded ok so now were fine so the next step you
created all of you have created this JSON file write Genesis 3 dot JSON ok so after this can you save it save it and close this window so now so all of you right you see here that is in a can you scroll above Mohit so
I found one thing wrong Arsenal the difficulty is an is missing missing a double coat and there is this colon is twice to everybody has to manually fix it ok or I will do it I have this Kiss custom Genesis doesn't let me send to all of you give me a minute or you are fixed it right we have a fixed yet can you send it
can I send a file and not a file you can copy paste it or I will do one thing I also have the file my cute so let me let us follow the file which is given by during only should be good
ok so what is that you are trying to my keyboard has not taking back
I'm just want to give you the file should I try to start the blockchain you just send it to me now let's not start the blockchain ok let's hold on for a while so all of you right so can you all copy paste this stuff so there was a small typo
that is fixed in this Genesis not JSON Canal copy paste this one the stuff in the Genesis dot JSON file ok so after doing that what I want you to do is ok we are not going to follow this one OK what we will do it can you all click on this folder folder icon so click on it so this will open a folder ok so
what we will do is click on Goa theory I'm ok so we have created a folder called Genesis right so I think here there is no e ok so it depending upon that so you want to renew it to Genesis let's rename right
ok so grace can you go back to Genesis photos try guys what I want you to do is go ethereum we are inside Genesis folder ok so now right click and create a folder called data there can you create One data d a r
ok fine guys are we all good till here so that is a Genesis 3 dot Jason apart from that we are creating a folder called data d a year or be good till here can I get a Quick As I know I got a good from Rakesh how about others
good from Sudhir lovika Jason Farhan Anand Subhash ok so I'll take it is ok now what is that we are going to do is let's all go into command prompt terminal window So being in this terminal window
Sudeep I am sorry but you have to go to the folder called Genesis folder name is wrong ok so been here what I want you to type is get space get out let me type in the command so that you know everyone is able to follow on 2nd let me show my screen so you all can type give me a minute
no no never been set build Ben get I think we should also we need to do it again so what we need to do is open this
Basha see ok so at the end of it you have this right this line so end of it what do you do with what is a path Mohit Dollar home so you can start with dollar then then go with him go with idiom and build pendrive yes
can you confirm once building so after doing this will have to do this ok guess this is just to set the path of get ok I'm going to send it to everybody yes so I got there I can give you the path
absent everybody I hope all of you have got it ok so the next step is right we need to create a data directory so I hope all of you have created a data directory so the next step is CD we will get into this go ethereum folder ok inside this go ethereum folder we will be into Genesis folder
ok so let's ok after this step what we need to do is get account new iPhone iPhone data de yaar and will have 2.2 this path ok so I am sending it to all of you so after this device you know what I have sent right after that
so can you share your screen computer that integrates overlap
since there is an error it will be an error for everybody so ok
show all of you write sudhakalash command which I sent you log into this directory and presenter ok so it is asking for a passphrase OK so just give me give some passphrase like admin aradura count 123 whatever it is ok just remember it
impress again repeat the passphrase hit enter ok now go to the in a folder window click on that no go inside data directory you can see a folder called keystore ok so this is where your private keys are store OK what is your account and what is your relevant private kit is stored inside this keeps ki store food
make sense guys are we good till here can I get a Quick SR no ok Jason not completed find that's ok still doing it ok fine let's all
do it in the meantime let Let me find out the next command which you need to execute ok give me a second let me show my screen letter not follow the document for 6 ok
does our data directory is different so that's why
severe here the Genesis folder then we are initialising our Genesis touches ok guess so this is the command we need to execute next ok so this will initialised
1st Block why it is called Genesis is nothing but this is the first block of your blockchain Sudhir what do I enter passphrase you can give your own password its like a password like in I can give you record your account to 3 whatever it is
Shailendra get command not found getting to get a gift Centre I hope you have typed in get not get so get command not getting OK so the
that's why I mentioned this one right so all of you what will have to do is set to the get binary path ok so these are the steps let me send you Shailendra you have to follow this step
ok so let me or be good to hear you will have to in it in it is the next step Mohit can you share your screen
OU you are not able to copy paste it I can I can you can read ok but I am not inside the data directory Heights would it still be able to Genesis doctors patient
looks like or Genesis file is wrong there is a braces here can you go back to the Ottoman window
it says invalid character looking at the bikini at me quickly find it out in a second solid Genesis right yeah I am I can quickly so I think it is
any problem with the edureka inno setup itself Naveen when same problem this is JSON format has an issue give me a quick quick second did you type in the right command get the gift looks like you're typing geet once but this is this is different and install them
Sumit Sharma file ok no problem ok let me in the meantime check it out it will get
Churu special issue was on the line 7 lines of 6000 dismil comma after the EP 158 block yeah this, should not be there this is last one right here then I have another Vishu which is extreme was length 50 to 164 for common daughters
read minute just let me know what I'm going to do is Let me find out my Genesis files which was working fine
so guys I want you to replace this file with whatever I give ok so this was the working version so let's not try with what to add yureka
let me send it out to you the coinbase should be sure coin we should be so it can be anything but farmersville said
080 in a second okay so I'll also give a quick and you know quick theory about like what is this Genesis file why we need to set these details ok basically what we are trying to do is we are configuring our blockchain with the first ever block ok with the for the 1st block it needs
details so what are those details that details in this something called chain ID ok by default if you look at public chain public Chinese ID number one ok and test night I think its number 2 3 4 5 and goes on ok in your private chain you can create your own network ID so this network ID here probly 99 123 whatever you want you can name it ok so then followed by homestead block so that is the current version brn
OK so the current if you look at the current ETA reimbursing we are in homestead version this peoples related to encryption related so let's not get into this so the remaining parameters ok so nonce announces as it is a 1st Block that is nothing you remember we discussed about proof of work how launch numbers get changed to find the inner find the puzzle so for 1st Block there is inner wear
call going to solve any person against the first block so you can give some random number ok and timestamp whatever you want to mention this a 1st Block that's fine with 080 parent has there won't be any parents because I was the first block so there is no parent has and difficulty so remember I told you the if you look at the first ever block it had a difficulty rate 1 then it keeps on change it was changing when we look that Bitcoin
1000 the difficulty level was almost a bilion right so likewise initially you can set whatever difficult you want but automatically network will find out how many miles are there in your network and this parameter will get automatically adjust it okay so the next parameter is gas limit for cash limit is nothing but so is for block has to be how much your block size is it going to be your hero defining your net
that if a person is sending a transaction it can have a maximum mode of this much gas ok like say that in a 10000 gases only permissible you can set that here ok so that is this gas limited so mixtures not much relevant let's leave it and coinbase what is coinbase is so when you set up your first block if if the money happens if you are going to mine ok you are
and it will go to the first block all the or otherwise you remember me who is going to generate ITR for the network some Account right so if someone is mining someone has to reward them with his teachers right same with Bitcoin so once you solve the puzzle your network gives you 12.5 Bitcoins ok so that first ever account which is going to get created is called coinbase account so this is that typically Wiki
habitus 08000 so this is the first account this is the account which network users to send Bitcoins to their Minds rates of the get Bitcoins from this address make sense so now what I am going to do is I am going to send you this to all of you have sent everybody so what do you do with
do a g edit I'll send you that comment also give me a minute ok you know I use this command I tried it it seems like the coinbase is wrong cannot unmarshal extn of odd length
it is. Basically fine cannot initialise string of odd length I think it's only length is wrong ok just give me a minute since you tried that's good enough
tomorrow I am just sending it to you alone ok let's not talk in a minute
can you try it sometime
I talked to a great ok good so guys I am going to send this one okay so there where some missing zeros ok in terms of length ok so what happened this is this get version right they keep changing and that's why this let me send again to all of you so first run this command
so once in a once you're done this ji edit command to open the file ok so replace with the content what I am sending you right now ok
ok so what you have done I've explained you like what is this Genesis file know what we are trying to do is we are trying to initialise this Genesis file you can I find data the year in it this file this command is what you have to run after this step ok so let me quickly take more hits machine
ok so can I get a Quick cash flow from guys all of you so what should have happened this once you copy paste that file and wins once you run this command you should have seen the success message at the final line you should be seeing that successfully Road Genesis state are we all getting this message
suggestion get command does not function for me so can you like that other questions to let me see so Sudhir good
and others so how about Shailendra and others Jason have having some problem just in the problem right so probly you know your path is not set right that's why you are not able to see the get command give me a minute so did you try this one
so this is the one ok suggest Jason have sent you just find out whether you did this part ok ok so now can you open Mohit can you open the folder window I can explain what has happened right now so now what happened is previously going to data directory to insert data directory what happened is
and we created get the count knew it created a keystore where and all or private keys get stored ok no go to get so go inside get in get you find two things ok one is change data one is light change data okay so lights and data is suppose you wanted to your having a mobile device or if you want to know if you don't want to sync the entire block so there is a way that you could sing
the important parameters ok so that's why there is a light change it now it's going to the chain that only going said change it ah ok so here to see some of the details right so here is where all your did you know your chain let's go to light chain data go to get here go to data directory
ok keystone fine so here is where all your chain hang out we haven't done anything right now all we have done is initialise the chain once we started meaning we can see more details inside this get folder how your block is getting from your block history all those details would get stored right now you see only the initialisation details make sense
ok for Shailendra also its working so how about others Anand Farhan jason's were you able to get it ok done ok that's good Mallika Rakesh Shri Subhash OK so the next step what we're going to do is we know that now yes or no change is ready
let's go to the command window ok give me a minute let me only send the command give me a minute guys ok so what what have they given in the
unit step is done to the next one is there creating account so this is not required for US for now so what we are going to do is get we know what is a data directory iPhone iPhone network
id I think the network ID whatever we have mentioned this 123 right ok 123 so is there any and we should come soon ok so this is the command all of you going to try so this will start our private Singh ok so first probably be right so let me take
Screen Award can you share your screen so once you type in the command whatever I were given presenter ok so now at first right so you can see lot of things coming up can you scroll above Mohit
a little bit until further further up Ha yar leave it here ok so all of you right just give me a second so you can see something like initialise change configuration ok so all of you initially is change configuration and change ID you can see 123 it means that you have now successfully started up
getting ok so all of you if you can see till hear your started the private chain you should see 123 ok if you are seeing any other number then it means that your connected to other thing ok public chain or some test changed something like that you should see only one two three here make sense
can I get a quicker so no we all good tell here and guys do you have time for another 10 hour 15 minutes so we can look at some of the commands so I don't know about others timing like 15 minutes Max shouldn't crossover cross beyond that
yes very good hotels I will go the majority ok so majority is ok with 15 minutes ok yes but I'll take 2 minutes wait and I'll be back you have the control ok fine no prob so Anand Farhan are we good where you were you able to run it
ok good fine fine now what are you want you to try is so all of you right being here ok so right now what what has happened this for some reason I don't have access
so all of you what you can do is being in this command line right let me quickly show my screen search circuit theory ok so what we are seeing us so we are now in window like command window where we can type in some commands Ok
what it is nothing but we are connected to a VM OK so the underlying DBMS here if we are connected to the IBM and we can all type and interact with him so that is what we were trying will try to do ok so easy I'm so now you can type it ok in the command window and press enter you can see a list of commands available options you can see and then you can type in admin and press enter you can see a list of commands ok and you can type
personal presenter you can see list of commands ok can you I'll give it a try so basically what we are doing is from the command window we are trying to interact with IBM of a machine make sense okay Sumit Mohit are you back
your back right ok so let me quickly can you share your screen ok so now all I suppose latest type it that accounts ok or the other ways what you can do this type it out and when you press a double tablet you can find out what all commands are there pressure double tab
ok so this all commands are there ok so these all these all or nothing but not just commands all these commands whatever we are trying to use right all these can be used by a node SDK API if you are good at Java you can use Java APS ok and you can use APS to interact with IBM you are getting the. So let me quickly share my screen so
this is IBM right this is IBM CEO with the IBM you need to interact so that is a whole point of Renault how to interact with blockchain right so what are the ways now whatever we are seeing right now is a camera and way ok so command we how do we interact suppose if you are good at Java ok and you want to eat less Java then you can use Java libraries and interact with me I'm so sleepy I haven't tried with Java libraries ok so I don't know if it is measured at
so I go with node SDK free pizza there ok we use web 3S and 3S and then interact with IBM ok so for our inner for a project also will be using with 3 apk use web therapy and whatever commands hear your listing he brought Account right same thing you can use suppose you have a JavaScript be called BF3 dot accounts you can use with other accounts make sense
ok so so this quick period now let's going to practical some of the commands I can show you how it works and then let's do a simple mining all these ok so can you click on that accounts
sweetheart accounts will list out like you know what a what are the accounts you have ok so now let's create one more account click in a type and personal that new account enter presenter ok so no no no no no personal account ok in the double coat can you open in a braces
MP you don't give anything presenter prasanta ok so it created new account Centre so now you see that there are two accounts likewise you can do there are multiple commands you can
try ok so now type in admin.py questions admin.py years just give me a minute admin.py Centre ok so this is enough how many pairs we have it is showing our own period I believe ok ok
fine so any any any questions now I'll take out some questions in a before that before even taking Ipill questions let us run command so that it will take a while to build OK then I will take up questions ok so I may not start you don't have any peers ok that's fine Jason I think I don't know how it connected another beer
ok so minor that start ok so you'll have to and presenter ok like this ok so if you do this what is happening is OK it will say that generating dad in progress OK what it means is for your proof of algorithm to work ok so initial Dag initial graph is required even though if you have created the first Genesis block that is fine it will do some permutation come
station to find out to it will make sure your tree or your merkle tree is ready or not to for the further blocks so this will take a while so all of you what I want you to do is type this command it will take a while likes in 5 minutes ok so in that time I will take up all the questions ok give me a quick minute commandname let me send to everybody minor dots
that's all of you I hope you got my command ok if you type this command centre and you can see that your dad is in progress ok so this will take a while so till then I will take up some questions okay so it so if you want me to earn by YouTube
completely fine let me know so first problem getting more it is having some questions let me go then you go and do with Sunil these accounts write these accounts are like private keys correct public is public is ok but they should have a corresponding private caregiver that private key is what you sow in the death in the Store folder if you go inside the folder window any going to the folder
so here go inside Genesis folder go to keystore ok can you right click open with said its ok so here is where your private key store but your private key is also again encrypted and stored so that's why we into the past
remember we enter passphrase right so yeah that is also again encrypted so directly you can't see your private key one question I have is like if I remember correctly to transact or how to generate a private or public key private key combination you don't need to connect to the aquarium blockchain correct that's right sugar in this case but you can also do
connected to the ethereum email is not also correct you can
hello
